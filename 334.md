**PHI 334 Business Ethics**  
**Instructor**: Keith Buhler  
**Email**: [keith.buhler@uky.edu](emailto:keith.buhler@uky.edu)  
**Twitter**: keith_buhler  
**Office Hours**: Wed 2-3pm, before/after class, and by appointment.   
**Office**: Patterson Office Tower, 14th floor.   

**Course Description:** Some of the hardest decisions we make have to do with business. As employees, professionals, managers, investors, or entrepreneurs, we will make tough business decisions every day. Even as consumers we will "vote with our dollars" when we buy product, use, re-use, and recycle. This course attempts to help us to think deeply about the issues of wealth, fairness, politics, trade, payment, and work. The aim is that we can act well when hard decisions come. 

Philosophy in generally asks questions about foundations of the world and our knowledge of it: what is real, how do we know what we know, what is the meaning of life? Philosophy is continuous with science, mathematics, religion. So when we conduct business, our whole world view is engaged. Ethics is the branch of philosophy that investigates right and wrong, good and bad. What is worthwhile or worthless and how to live a worthwhile life. What is good? Who is truly enviable? 

So, in business ethics, we ask about foundations: What is a good business? What is success? What is private and public property? Are there constraints on products and services one can provide? 

These questions and more we will attempt to answer by clarifying terms, establishing secure ethical principles, being sensitive to contextual details, identifying reasonable answers, evaluating arguments for and against each reasonable answer, and coming to our own conclusions. Though we will consider arguments from Kantian, consequentialist, and religious standpoints, our official approach to these questions will be from the standpoint of traditional virtue ethics.

Each of us belongs to a tradition and a community. Our goal is to understand our own tradition and understand rival traditions, and why they disagree. We will disagree, but do so peacably and with understanding. 

The bottom line is always to think hard about hard questions, to discard wrong answers and discover and prove right answers to these questions. The hard questions will revolve around business, wealth, justice, safety, information, incenvtives, globalization, etc. but may branch out to related tangents including logic, public policy, anthropology, religion, law, and more. 

**Course Goals:** 

* to understand business as part of life
* to understand business as part of applied ethics, public policy, and as a sub-discipline of ethical philosophy
* to become familiar with major ethical theories, especially: virtue ethics, utilitarianism, and deontology 
* to grow intellectually by critically analyzing articles, books, studies, and news articles about business
* to understand our own ethical tradition better and make clear plans for how to make hard decisions
* Also to understand the tradition of others (religious ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics) in approaching ethical issues;
* and thereby to become more virtuous people capable of handling difficult life circumstances.

**Structure**:  To accomplish our course goals, the semester is broken into 8 units of 1-2 weeks each. Each Unit consists of (a) readings and quizzes, (b) lectures, (c) discussions, and (d) a unit paper. The readings and lectures offer analysis, the discussions and papers synthesis. 

**Grading**: Your grade for the class will depend on your performance in each course component, plus tests and applicable extra credit.To get an ‘A’: (a) read carefully every week, (b) attend and participate in class through talking and/or writing, (c) study hard for the tests, and (d) write the Unit Papers according to the given instructions.


|  Assessment category  |  Percent of semester grade |
| -----------------------| -----------------------|
| Readings (quizzes) |         20%   |  
| Participation (talk, write, present) |   20% |
| Tests (midterm, final)         |  30% |
| Unit Papers    |  30% |




**Reading Tips:** Read ahead. Read carefully. You will get faster, but start slow and careful. Try to read *and understand* the book. What is the main thesis? Is it true?  Take notes. Talk with each other before class. More are tips available online.

**Quizzes:**Short reading quizzes assess that you read the day's text. These are easy points. Also, read to *understand*. Come to class with thoughts, questions. Ask yourself: What is the main point? What confused me? 

**Attendance**: We need you here! Attendance is mandatory. Roll will be taken each class. (Repeated tardies count as absences.) 1 to 3 absences are "freebies" -- the first four are excused no matter what. No credit lost. After the 3rd absence, I will need an excuse or else points will be deducted. 4-7 absences cause major deductions to the semester grade; 8 is a full letter grade deduction. You are paying for this education including this class, so why wouldn’t you make the most of it?  

**Participation:** The primary competency of this class is philosophical dialogue. Hence, you must attend and participate. Class time is primarily focused on discussion of the material for which I expect you to be fully engaged. 

We do dialogue for five main reasons: (1) You must take responsibility for your own learning. (2) We can actually get to know each other.  (3) I learn best in discussion. (4) Most people learn (and retain) best in discussion. (5) Philosophy is dialogical. 

*You are responsible to talk in class.* Even if you are confused, tired, or unmotivated, I expect you to make yourself participate and engage. Get out of your comfort zone into your growth zone. Come *prepared*. Read, take notes, reflect, and come ready to share your viewpoint, defend it, listen to others' viewpoints, and critique theirs.  

Everyone starts at an 80% (B-) for the participation grade. You will move up or down depending on whether you pay attention and speak at least once per week. (I prohibit the use of electronic devices in class, although laptop users may request permission to sit in the front of class with their computers.) Other discussion ground rules are posted online. 

To earn participation points, you will voluntarily share your thoughts in discussion at least once per week, and/or respond when called upon. You are not required to write posts on the discussion board online. By default, everyone is an "external processor".  *"Internal processors"*: Some may wish to opt out of speaking in class and emphasize writing.  To earn participation points, you will post class reflections online every week. You may elect to speak in class as well, and may be called upon.



**Critical Reading**: Every student will present two group "critical readings." Your group of 2-3 people must meet ahead of time to read and discuss the assignment more thoroughly than your normal reading. You will then summarize the reading, analyze it, and present your own opinions. One or all of you will present your summary to the class. Instructions are posted online. 

**Tests:** There is a Quarter 1 and Quarter 3 exams. The "Study Guide" with all the questions will be posted online. 

**Unit Papers:** Every student will write about 5 Unit Papers. These Unit Papers help you synthesize your own views after doing the readings and listening to lectures and participating in the discussions. This assignment is pass/fail, so follow the instructions closely. Be careful to cite your sources correctly. I will not tolerate plagiarism — unintentional or intentional.  If I detect plagiarism, I will contact you. The assignment will receive a zero, and disciplinary action may follow. The instructions are posted online. 

**Extra Credit:** Those who opt for extra credit may do so. Instructions are posted online. 


### Miscellany:

1. **Bring your textbook** to every class. 
2. **Participate.** Participation is your responsibility; I may or may not call on you. Challenge yourself!
3. **Stay focused.** Do not distract yourself with side conversations, texting, Facebook, or doing anything else in class. Take a short mental break or bathroom break if you need to, but come back. (If you have an important phone call or text, please step outside the class for a moment, then return.)
4. **No smart phones.** No other electronics, laptops, iPhones, or iPads, iPods, smartphones, etc. Unplug, listen and engage.
4.  **Laptop/tablet users:** You must request permission, and if approved, sit in the front row.
5. **Be respectful of others**: Pay attention when a neighbor is talking. No teasing. Don’t pack up early. 
6.  **Contact me.** Best method is to chat after class. I read every email but may not respond to every email. You need a response, and I haven’t responded within three (3) business days, email again with the subject “nudge”. Please use keith.buhler@uky.edu rather than my Asbury email.
7.  **Contact**. For short, quick questions, use Twitter (keith\_buhler)
8.  **Email**. You are expected to have an active e-mail account that you check regularly, and to check Discovery “news”. Section related announcements will be made on Discovery “news” and/or via e-mail  (e.g. if I am sick, pointers for home work, change in due dates).
6. Disabilities can be accommodated if you are registered with the Disability Resource Center. See  http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/DisabilityResourceCenter/
7. Make up work is not accepted after the due date, unless you obtain prior (email) permission. 
8. **Plagiarism**. Do not plagiarize. Intentional or unintentional plagiarism will result in a a zero for the assignment, and jeopordizes your standing in the class. Do not intentionally take anyone else’s work nor provide your work to anyone else (under whatever auspices). You’ll submit your papers to SafeAssign on Blackboard to help avoid accidental plagiarism. Don’t even think about stealing someone else’s thought/work.  Cite your sources. [See also the UK academic integrity appendix](/ukplagiarism %).
9. **Enjoy philosophy.** We are not merely solving abstract puzzles here, but digging deeply into human thinking in a way that could change your life forever. The more you and your fellows allow yourselves to acquire a “taste” for the material, the more inclined you will be to give it the real effort required to master it.

### Detailed outline and Lecture Notes


* W       Aug-24  Syllabus day  

Today we go over the syllabus and set expectations. 


* F       Aug-26  Introduction to Business Ethics  

What is business ethics? Ethics applied to business. Business ethics is done by those with a philosophy background or those with a business background.  We are approaching it from philosophy and ethics. What is philosophical ethics? The best thinking about the best ideas in the universe; goodness, truth, and beauty; justice, utility, rights, obligations, and personal virtues.  We progress by conversation. We have to stand back from our personal knee-jerk viewpoint or cultural viewpoints. What if something deep about our collective way of viewing things is wrong? How would we correct it? Only by stepping back and considering views wide afield. 



* M       Aug-29  Basic Philosophy: Peter Kreeft, Truth  

What is Kreeft's basic thesis? That truth is real and objective. That it is possible to know what's what, and that no skeptical challenge to that possibility can stand up to scrutiny. 

* W       Aug-31  Basic Philosophy: Peter Kreeft, Moral Relativism

Is the moral law unreal or real? Are rules like "human beings do not steal" just as real as "apples grow on apple trees"? 


* F       Sep-2   Basic Ethics: Religion & Reason  

Most people are religious; that is, they adhere to a particular religious tradition and/or they believe that the universe was created or sustained by God. Religion and ethics have a complex relationship. 

I don't need to see a show of hands: but probably about 2 in 10 of us in this room are non-religious or unaffiliated, while about 8 are affiliated with a particular religious tradition. 

Religion and ethics have a complex relationship. Today I'd like to get expectations and context right. First, I'll go over some statistics you may not know about religious adherence. Then, I'll apply some of these demographic statistics to business. Then I'll explain one of the most common ways religion affects ethics and therefore business ethics.  

How many people are religious?
How many people are secular?
How many people are immoral?
How many people are moral?

1. Statistics 

In the US Today: 

68% Christian
10% other religious affiliation 
22% unaffiliated total
including atheists (5-8%), agnostics, humanists, 
and “spiritual but not religious” nones (5-8%). 

TOTAL: 
78% Religious 
22% non-Religious

In general, 7 out of 10 people are religious. 
In general, 2 out of 10 people are unaffiliated, spiritual, agnostic, or atheist. 

Exceptions: 
Academia (50% religious)
Philosophy (15% religious)
Science (42% religious)
Entertainment industry?
News Media?

Compare with: The Czech Republic, 21% of people are religious. Sweden and Denmark have 17%-18%, Japan is 31% atheist. America has 5%-15% atheists

So how does this affect business? Some businesses are composed of mostly religious people; some are composed of mostly secular people. Some businesses take a public stand on religion. Others don't. 


US Business: 
Chick Fil A
Tyson
Forever 21
Mary Kay
Alaska Airlines
Hobby Lobby
Tom’s 
Salvation Army
AA

Non-religious:
Starbucks
Popeye’s
Michael’s
GoodWill
Rational Recovery

But when it comes to their ethics, most people take some cues from their religion. 

Divine Command Theory is the view that morality in some way depends on God or the divine. The straightforward version of Divine Command Theory is the Judeo-Christian version where God tells his people how to live and what not to do. That is not the only version, however. It might be that we know how to live and what not to do even without divine commands; but that god gives commands for other reasons than knowledge, such as encouragement. 

Michael Austin says: 

"A strong version of Divine Command Theory includes the claim that moral statements (x is obligatory) are defined in terms of theological statements (x is commanded by God). At the other end of the spectrum is the view that the commands of God are coextensive with the demands of morality. God’s commands do not determine morality, but rather inform us about its content."

(i) God in some sense determines what is moral; (ii) moral obligations are derived from God’s commands, where these commands are understood as statements of the revealed divine will.

## Possible advantages of Divine Command Theory

1. Immanuel Kant argues that "we must believe that God exists because the requirements of morality are too much for us to bear. We must believe that there is a God who will help us satisfy the demands of the moral law. With such a belief, we have the hope that we will be able to live moral lives." (Austin)
2.  That is, if the origin of the universe is a personal moral being, then the existence of objective moral truths are at home, so to speak, in the universe. By contrast, if the origin of the universe is non-moral, then the existence of such truths becomes philosophically perplexing, because it is unclear how moral properties can come into existence via non-moral origins.

## Possible disadvantages of Divine Command Theory
1. The motive for being moral might become merely to avoid punishment or gain bliss. 
2. Eutyphro Dilmemma

 We ought to love one another because God commands us to do so.  (What if he commands something immoral?)
God commands us to love one another because that is what we ought to do. (Moral goodness is independent of God, and he is subject to it)



* M       Sep-5   Labor Day  

* W       Sep-7   Basic Ethics: Utilitarianism  

The utilitarian believes that the good is pleasure; that is the only intrinsic good. Every other good is extrinsic, or instrumental. Every other good brings about pleasure or reduces pain.
