<h2> 1. Introduction</h2>
 There is a great deal of confusion about both philosophy (which is my field) and natural science. To know the history of science and the history of philosophy is, at least in part, to cease to be confused.  
  
 This article attempts to present that history, to clarify concepts, and to define terms for the sake of professional academics, interested students, and anyone else. It attempts to make clear and to defend the traditional way of dividing up human knowledge of all of reality. 
  
 The punchy way of putting my thesis is that philosophy is science.&nbsp;, I'm not being sarcastic. I'm not crazy (at least that's what the voices in my head keep telling me). 
  
 But of course by putting the point like this, I'm picking fights. So let me be quick to assure you that by asserting "philosophy is science" I don't mean something ridiculous like "professional philosophers are employed in biology departments" or "philosophical theorems are empirically verifiable" or "professional scientists spend all their time bloviating about the meaning of words" -- all of which are obviously false. 
  
 Perhaps another way of putting my thesis is this: properly understood, '<b>philosophy' and 'science' refer to the same thing: the sum of all human knowledge</b>. The only differences between science and philosophy are the differences between this branch of philosophy and that branch of philosophy, or this branch of science and that branch of science. The really important distinction is between truth and falsity. For there is no such thing as <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-theaetetus/#SecPuzAboFalBelBelWhaNot188189">"false knowledge."</a> 
  
 Here's an attempt to articulate the full thesis: <b>Even though there are real differences between disciplines along distinctions of subject matter, method, and professional association, all disciplines (whether currently labelled 'science' or currently labeled 'philosophy' in U.S. colleges and encyclopedias) are bodies of knowledge, methods of attaining knowledge and rejecting false beliefs, maintaining that knowledge in a community of professional teachers, scholars, and researchers, and passing that knowledge to the next generation, all the while subject to scrutiny and accountability by future&nbsp;practitioners. </b> 
  
 The argument requires learning some history, defining terms in light of their historical meaning, and re-thinking how we classify different kinds of knowledge. 
  
 There are objections to this thesis. You can't object to the history, but you not want to redefine your own terms or re-think how you classify knowledge. I don't think the objections ultimately stand up to scrutiny. 
  
 Instead of objections, much of the resistance to this thesis, ironically, is an anti-scientific and anti-philosophical dogma that divorces philosophy and science. Some people are so wedded to this dogma that my arguments will threaten their ideology and they will only respond with insults, "psychologizing", appeal to motives (like suggesting that I am insecure about my profession), mockery, and so on. While I welcome any comments, my reply to ad hominem or or fallacious comments will only be emoticons. 
  
 For the scientifically-minded, you might find something of interest. Let's see if I can convince you -- or at least make you think. 
<h2> 2. Philosophy and science are the same thing.</h2>
 Arguments from authority do not end arguments, but they are good beginnings. 
  
 1.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/our-narrow-definition-of-science">Sam Harris argues that</a>, "There is no clear border between philosophy and science." That is because, by our present definitions, they are both disciplines aiming at gaining truth and avoiding falsity. 
  
 2. And&nbsp;, Peter Singer summarizes the traditional view that, "Any serious study of a phenomenon is scientific... the broader view of science [includes everything] from genetics to economics... the German term&nbsp;<i style="font-family: times new roman, helvetica, sans-serif;">wissenschafte</i>, &nbsp;includes philosophy and ethics... Not just [natural] science but careful thought and careful reflection..." 
  
 My thesis is philosophy is science, and science is philosophy -- there is one thing: knowledge and the pursuit of knowledge.&nbsp;, The Oxford English Dictionary definition of 'science' and 'philosophy' bear this out. &nbsp;'Science' means 'knowledge, understanding acquired by study ' and 'philosophy' means 'knowledge, learning, scholarship; a body of knowledge.' 
  
 Distinctions matter. But t, he current distinctions between "science" and "philosophy" or even between "empirical" and "theoretical" knowledge, obscure more than they help. 
  
 The distinctions that matter are those between&nbsp;<i>true</i> and <i>false</i> judgments, between <i>knowledge about different kinds of objects known, </i>different methods, and different professional associations.&nbsp;, &nbsp;, All these distinctions apply across physics, metaphysics, biology, ethics, logic, cosmology, etc. 
  
 In contemporary terms, n, atural science is the pursuit of truth about the world by the best methods available; while philosophy is the pursuit of truth about reality by the best methods available. But&nbsp;, science (without the qualification 'natural') is the pursuit of truth about the world by the best methods available.,  
  
 So science most broadly and philosophy most broadly are the same project: the pursuit and acquisition of knowledge about anything that <i>is.&nbsp;</i> 
  
 If you disagree, then probably you think "science" refers to something more specific than "knowledge" and/or you think "philosophy" is not that specific thing. So first I have to show you&nbsp;, that the term 'science' does not mean exactly what you think it means, and then I have to show you that the term 'philosophy' does not mean exactly what you think it means. 
  
 On the proper senses of both of these terms, we can see that the two concepts converge on the unitary concept of truth, and methods that are effective in finding truth. In this light, the distinctions between truths and methods are perfectly&nbsp;explicable&nbsp;as sub-disciplines of&nbsp;science/philosophy/knowledge. 

 
  
  
 <b>Isn't Science a Method?&nbsp;</b> 

 
 In common usage the term "science" either means (1) "knowledge," the content, the ideal encyclopedia of all truths; &nbsp;(2) or "method", the process by which we acquire new knowledge. 

 


  
 My thesis includes the claim that every method that works to acquire knowledge&nbsp;is, be definition, scientific.&nbsp;Arguments employing concepts, mathematical, geometrical, empirical, and logical arguments&nbsp;knowledge, every truth, and every real entity that can be known is "science.&nbsp;, By contrast, e, very method that doesn't work, every falsehood, every fictional or imaginary entity is unscientific, and unphilosophical. 
  
 

 
  
 <b>The demarcation problem (or "science is not even scientific")</b> 
 The demarcation problem is the challenge of coherently distinguishing between science and non-scientific knowledge (like philosophy, art, or poetry) or non-knowledge (so called "pseudoscience", mythology, and falsehood). 
  
 A solution would underwrite our intuitive or sociologically entrenched belief that, say, humanities are not sciences, but that astrology is not even a discipline. 
  
 The loose string that proves the demarcation problem is mathematics and logic. Are math and logic sciences? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_science">Wikipedia says so.</a> They are "formal" sciences. If formal sciences need not be empirical in the same way biology is, then we have a precedent for non-empirical science. And m, etaphysics is such a non-empirical science. 
  
 
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/The_Scientific_Universe.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"> <img border="0" height="240" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/The_Scientific_Universe.png" width="320" /></a>
  
  
 If logic is not a formal science, then the absurdity of absurdity follows: all of the logic upon which biology, chemistry, sociology, computer science, and every other science is built is non-scientific. If logic is not a science, then none of the other sciences are sciences. The same goes for mathematics. 
  
 So conclude that logic and mathematics are formal sciences. The methods of logic and math are scientific methods (even though abstract, non-experimental, and not empirical). The conclusions of logic and math are scientific conclusions. 
  
 The demarcation problem has no solution. That is, coherently to deny that (say) philosophy and ethics are sciences requires denying that formal disciplines such as mathematics, logic, statistics, information theory, systems theory, and linguistics are sciences; but coherently to admit that philosophy is a science requires admitting that other humanistic disciplines such as art, psychology, psychotherapy, literature, and poetry are sciences. One must pick one or the other of these perhaps surprising options. I choose the latter. 
  
  
 The only useful, and demonstrably reasonable demarcation is between 'scientia' (knowledge) and not-knowledge; that is, between true and false. 

 
  
 Just to be clear: I am pro science. I love science. I trust that scientific methods are the best means of garnering scientific knowledge of scientific facts. I love astronomy, technology, evolutionary biology, comparative anatomy, paleontology, metaphysics, logic, and epistemology.  
  
 I think tardigrades are cooler than tachyons, but both are cool. I think the deliverances of the various sciences are stable but also imperfect and always improving — the methods of science are the best (or only) ways of improving the established body of scientific knowledge. I think the truths science discovers are truths about the world. 
  
 But I am open-minded about what counts as a science. Let success vet. Let each discipline use its methods and justify its conclusions. 
  
 The only thing that demarcates science from non-science is that science is knowledge and non-science is not. It's what demarcates truth from falsehood. Nothing else. That is, scientific methods are whatever methods — material or formal — that deliver true conclusions. The body of scientific knowledge is the body of true conclusions. Non-science is whatever is not true or whatever methods don’t result in true conclusions.  
  
 So, for example, some sciences are biology, physics, chemistry, sociology, history, metaphysics, ethics, and theology. Some other sciences are cosmology, logic, archeology, comparative anatomy, anesthesiology, psychology. Some of the people who do biology, physics, chemistry etc. make false statements. This does not mean that their field is no longer, broadly speaking, a science, a body of knowledge. Some of the people who do archeology, psychology, and math make false statements. Likewise, their field is still a science.   
  
 Ironically, most die-hard defenders of science and philosophy are not scientists but philosophers who ascribe to a particular <i>philosophy</i>: scientism. They think "science" is the collection of all truths and "philosophy" a collection of ... something other than truth. Their philosophy blinds them to the liberal nature of science and the liberal nature of philosophy. Their false opinion restricts their access to the broad universe of all knowledge. 
  
 But such have not reflected upon the demarcation problem. There is no clear definition of science that includes logic and math but excludes epistemology and metaphysics; there is no clear definition of science that excludes epistemology and metaphysics but includes logic and math. 
  
 Certainly, there are distinctions between different kinds of truth, but truth is unitary. 
  
  
 Such are also likely ignorant of the history of metaphysics, physics, astronomy, and ethics.&nbsp;To know the history of science and the history of philosophy is, at least in part, to cease to be confused.
 
<h2>
 3. Philosophy, Queen of sciences (or "not even philosophy is philosophy")</h2>

 
 What is philosophy about? It's hard to say. There are many schools of thought, and "philosophy" as a discipline has a long history. If any one thing unifies all who have gone under the title of 'philosopher', it has been an attempt to articulate the truth about reality in words. &nbsp;Even those who conclude, in the end, that truth is unavailable to human beings try to articulate <i>that </i>conclusion in words.&nbsp;, By such a broad definition, of course,&nbsp;<i style="font-family: times new roman, helvetica, sans-serif;">any&nbsp;</i>, natural&nbsp;science is a branch of philosophy. And that is exactly correct.&nbsp;

 
 

 
 <b>Historically, is philosophy 'science'?</b>

 
 Historically, t, he "philosophy of nature" referred to any study of biology, cosmology, physics, medicine, and so on. These bodies of knowledge aimed for "wisdom" and truth in their respective domains.&nbsp;

 
  
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AqwfnaIaLn4/VlrsMj7vs6I/AAAAAAABm3g/81TEy-PruZQ/s1600/philosophy.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"> <img border="0" height="322" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AqwfnaIaLn4/VlrsMj7vs6I/AAAAAAABm3g/81TEy-PruZQ/s400/philosophy.png" width="400" /></a>

 
  

 
  

 
 Every terminal degree, like a <i>doctor of philosophy in biology, </i>is a philosophy degree because 'philosophy' is another term for "knowledge."

 
  

 
 This historical fact is so uncontroversial, I can safely quote Wikipedia:

 
  
 
<blockquote style="font-family: Times;">
  Natural philosophy or the philosophy of nature (from Latin philosophia naturalis) was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science. It is considered to be the precursor of natural sciences. From the ancient world, starting with Aristotle, to the 19th century, the term "natural philosophy" was the common term used to describe the practice of studying nature. It was in the 19th century that the concept of "science" received its modern shape with new titles emerging such as "biology" and "biologist", "physics" and "physicist" among other technical fields and titles; institutions and communities were founded, and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred.[1] Isaac Newton's book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687), whose title translates to "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", reflects the then-current use of the words "natural philosophy", akin to "systematic study of nature". Even in the 19th century, a treatise by Lord Kelvin and Peter Guthrie Tait, which helped define much of modern physics, was titled Treatise on Natural Philosophy (1867).</blockquote>
 

 
<div style="font-family: Times;">
  The point here is that "philosophy" is a proper word to describe all human knowledge. That's why a biologist who goes for a doctorate becomes &nbsp;"doctor of philosophy in biology". The old and still most sensible use of the term "philosopher" is term for a biologist, physicist, cosmologist, psychologist etc. This held true the false divorce between philosophy and science was widespread in the west, and still holds true in some places.
 


 
  

 
 <b>Is what 'philosophers' do today science?</b>

 
 Contemporary academic philosophy is but one expression of the broader, historical sense of the term 'philosophy.' Is contemporary academic philosophy a science?&nbsp;

 
  

 
 &nbsp;<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/philosophy-by-another-name/" style="font-family: times new roman, helvetica, sans-serif;">Colin McGinn's argument</a>,  is basically correct:
  
 
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
 The dictionary defines a science as “a systematically organized body of knowledge on any subject.” This is a very broad definition, which includes not just subjects like physics and chemistry but also psychology, economics, mathematics and even “library science.”</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
 Academic philosophy obviously falls under this capacious meaning. Moreover, most of the marks of science as commonly understood are shared by academic philosophy: the subject is systematic, rigorous, replete with technical vocabulary, often in conflict with common sense, capable of refutation, produces hypotheses, uses symbolic notation, is about the natural world, is institutionalized, peer-reviewed, tenure-granting, etc. We may as well recognize that we are a science, even if not one that makes empirical observations or uses much mathematics. Once we do this officially, we can expect to be treated like scientists.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
 Someone might protest that we belong to the arts and humanities, not the sciences, and certainly we are currently so classified. But this is an error, semantically and substantively. The dictionary defines both “arts” and “humanities” as studies of “human culture”—hence like English literature or art history. But it is quite false that philosophy studies human culture, as opposed to nature (studied by the sciences); only aesthetics and maybe ethics fall under that heading. Metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, philosophy of physics and so on deal not with human culture but with the natural world. We deal with the same things the sciences deal with — the world beyond human culture. To classify philosophy as one of the “humanities” is grossly misleading — it isn’t even much about the human.</blockquote>
  
  , <b>Philosophy is which science?&nbsp;</b> 
 <b> </b>, Suppose you are persuaded that these are legitimate historical meanings of the terms 'science' and 'philosophy.' But aren't the subject matters different? Science is more concrete, and philosophy is more abstract, isn't it?&nbsp;, This question misses the point.&nbsp;, &nbsp;"Philosophy" is just another word for "science" or "knowledge," in which case there is no answer. Philosophy is not a particular science, it just, &nbsp;<i style="font-family: times new roman, helvetica, sans-serif;">is</i>, &nbsp;, science. 

 
  
 Using the terms <i>science </i>and&nbsp;<i>philosophy</i> to describe all knowledge forces us to be more articulate about the taxonomy of knowledge. Philosophers are up to something particular. 
  
 Suppose what philosophers do is, &nbsp;<i style="font-family: times new roman, helvetica, sans-serif;">a</i>, &nbsp;, science, which science is it?&nbsp;, What are metaphysicians and ethicists and epistemologists doing? This is a good question. 
  
 Most sciences are named by their&nbsp;<em style="font-family: times new roman, helvetica, sans-serif;">objects</em>, &nbsp;of study -- physics studies the physical, biology studies the living, geometry studies spatial measurement, etc. 
  
 Philosophers "study" concepts and the beings those concepts answer to. , &nbsp;So p, erhaps some of these disciplines within academic philosophy can be called "conceptual science". Since some of this think we don't <i>merely </i>study concepts but also the objects themselves,, &nbsp;we could go with Colin McGinn's solution:, &nbsp;<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/philosophy-by-another-name/" style="font-family: times new roman, helvetica, sans-serif;">metaphysics is "ontic science."</a>, &nbsp;(<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/name-calling-philosophy-as-ontical-science/" style="font-family: times new roman, helvetica, sans-serif;">His follow up article is just as good</a>, .) 
  
 My inclination is to let each speciality in philosophy define itself as a science by what it studies. &nbsp;So, to say that metaphysics is the science of beings, relations, properties, possibility, necessity, and so on; epistemology is the science of knowledge, truth, argument, warrant, justification, and so on; ethics is the science of good and bad, of moral judgments, of evaluative language, of character; logic is the science of inference, the rules of inference, the structure of arguments, and so on. 
  
 <b>Science and sciences</b> 
  
 Science/philosophy/knowledge is a group project. We are all in this together. We need each other. Biologists need paleontologists, and paleontologists need biologists. 
 &nbsp;, Likewise, formal sciences owe a debt to many physical sciences; and physical sciences owe a debt to formal sciences. Mathematics cannot get on without computers and would never have got on without architecture; but architecture cannot get on without mathematics. 
  
 Similarly, metaphysicians need concepts and facts from biologists; but biologists need concepts and clarity from metaphysicians.&nbsp;Psychologists&nbsp;need ethics and ethicists need psychology. Because all four of these disciplines are sciences, even though they are sciences of different kinds. 
  
 Much more could be said. But I should move on now to the most important part of the argument: replies to objections. 
  
 
<h2>
 4. Objections to the thesis that philosophy is science</h2>
 In the spirit of a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Summa-Philosophica-Peter-Kreeft/dp/1587318253">Thomistic disputation</a>, let's address objections. 
  
 This is a growing list of common objections. &nbsp;As I, &nbsp;receive feedback, I'll add more, so please leave comments below. 
  , A few (devastating, apparently conclusive) reasons to think&nbsp;<b>philosophy&nbsp;<i>is not science.</i></b> 
 
 ,  
<b><i>, Objection 1:&nbsp;Philosophy uses&nbsp; "rational tools of logical analysis and conceptual clarification" while science uses "empirical measurement" as&nbsp;<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/philosophy-is-not-a-science/?_r=0">Friedland argues.</a></i></b> 
  
 This objection assumes science is not philosophy and attempts to articulate the difference. But I have shown above that science and philosophy are coextensive. Mathematics is a rationalistic and not empirical science; applied mathematics is a rationalistic and empirical science. Metaphysics is a rationalistic and (usually) not empirical science; ethics is a rational and empirical science. 

 
  

 
 <i>, <b>Objection 2:&nbsp;</b><b style="font-family: times new roman, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Science is about nature, philosophy is about concepts.&nbsp;<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/philosophy-is-not-a-science/?_r=0">Science conducts experiments, philosophy only conducts thought experiments.</a></b></i>

 
<ul>
<li> This objection also mistakenly assumes science is not philosophy.&nbsp;</li>
<li> Also, "Quark" and "Higgs-boson particle" are concepts in physical science that are being debated across schools of thought but are agreed upon within schools of thought. "Nature" and "being" are concepts in metaphysical science that are being debated across schools of thought but are agreed upon within schools of thought.&nbsp;</li>
<li> Also, some physicists conduct thought experiments and some philosophers of mind conduct empirical experiments.</li>
</ul>


 
  

 
 <b>, Objection 3: S, cience progresses,&nbsp;<a href="http://philpapers.org/archive/DIETIN" style="font-family: times new roman, Helvetica, sans-serif;">philosophy doesn't progress</a>, &nbsp;but is&nbsp;<a href="http://consc.net/papers/progress.pdf" style="font-family: times new roman, Helvetica, sans-serif;">circular or stagnant</a>, , or&nbsp;<a href="https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/54908-empty-ideas-a-critique-of-analytic-philosophy/" style="font-family: times new roman, Helvetica, sans-serif;">empty.</a></b> 
 

 
<ul>
<li><span style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;times&quot; ,  , serif; line-height: 18.2px;">This objection assumes (a) that all disciplines that progress are sciences and (b) disciplines that do not progress are not sciences, and (c) that all progress is good, and (d) it mistakenly assumes that science is not philosophy. Three responses are possible:&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;times&quot; ,  , serif; line-height: 18.2px;">&nbsp;(a) Physics progresses (from Newton to Einstein), metaphysics progresses (from Anaxagoras to Aquinas).</li>
<li><span style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;times&quot; ,  , serif; line-height: 18.2px;">(b) Also, physics, metaphysics, ethics, logic and other disciplines can and does sadly regress. That doesn't mean they are not longer sciences, it means they have lost some truths or acquired some falsehoods.</li>
<li> <span style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family:  , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 18.2px;">(c) Not all "progress" is good.<span style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family:  , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 18.2px;">&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions" style="background-color: white; color: #4d469c; font-family: times new roman, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18.2px; text-decoration: none;">Some progress is neutral.</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family:  , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 18.2px;">&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family:  , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 18.2px;">Progress of a civilization toward decadence is not good, because decadence is not good. Progress of a philosophy department toward racial uniformity is not good because diversity is good. Furthermore, the true "progress" is not of the human race from generation to generation but of each human person within each generation.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;times&quot; ,  , serif; line-height: 18.2px;">(d) I dealt with above.</li>
</ul>


 
<b style="font-family: times new roman, Helvetica, sans-serif;">  </b>

 
 <b>, Objection 4:&nbsp;, Science deals with the nature of the universe (a la Aristotle's Physics); philosophy deals with the nature of causation (a la Aristotle's Metaphysics), as&nbsp;<a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/is-philosophy-a-science/45795" style="font-family: times new roman, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Michael Ruse argues.</a></b> 
 

 
<ul>
<li> This objection also mistakenly assumes science is not philosophy.&nbsp;, Circular reasoning.</li>
<li> Physicists deal with&nbsp;causation and metaphysicians deal with the nature of the universe. We should not be surprised that Michael Ruse thinks this. His&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism" style="font-family: times new roman, helvetica, sans-serif;">scientistic ideology</a>, &nbsp;is predicated on the belief that natural science can know everything that can be known, so there is no other form of science. But this is a philosophical belief and the proof of it is not empirical; so scientistic ideology is incoherent and self-defeating. Just because it masquerades as a justifiable and respectable scientific inference doesn't mean it's true. Just the opposite: it means scientism is pseudoscience.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>


 
  

 
 <b>, Objection 5:&nbsp;, Science is divided into physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, economics, and so on; philosophy is divided, &nbsp;into metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of mind, and so on. These are clearly separate domains.</b> 
<ul> 
<li>This objection also mistakenly assumes science is not philosophy.&nbsp;Circular reasoning.</li>
<li>It is true that there&nbsp;are different disciplines, distinguished by their subject matter, methods, and professional/sociological groups.</li>
</ul>
 


 
 <b> </b>

 
 <b>, , Objection 6:&nbsp;, Science has nothing to do with religion or gods; philosophy overlaps with religious questions like the existence of God, the "true nature of reality", what existed before time and space and what will exist after the heat death of the universe.</b> 
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-dawkins/why-there-almost-certainl_b_32164.html">Even Dawkins agrees that the existence of God makes a scientific difference.</a></li>
<li> Also, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse" style="font-family: times new roman, Helvetica, sans-serif;">multiverse theory</a>, &nbsp;is scientific but concerns the "true nature of reality".&nbsp;</li>
<li> This objection also mistakenly assumes science is not philosophy. Circular reasoning.</li>
</ul>


 
 <b> </b>

 
 <b>, Objection 7:&nbsp;, Scientific methods involve testable, confirmable hypotheses; philosophical methods involve abstract, untestable, unconfirmable hypotheses.&nbsp;</b> 
<ul>
<li> The demarcation problem shows this definition to be false. Formal sciences like logic and math are not empirically testable and not meaningless. I, f logic, mathematics, statistics, theoretical computer science, information theory, game theory, systems theory, and decision theory don't have to, then neither do metaphysics, ethics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li> Furthermore, some hypotheses in philosophy of mind and ethics are empirically testable.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
 <b>,  </b>
 <b>, Objection 8: Professional scientists do not call themselves philosophers; professional philosophers do not call themselves scientists.</b> 
<ul> 
<li>True but not strictly speaking an objection.&nbsp;</li>
<li>We who practice a discipline do not necessarily have time to re-think all the classificatory taxonomy by which our disciplines are related to each other and to all knowledge. We are too busy practicing our disciplines. But that doesn't mean that the "given" classificatory system is accurate. In fact, the taxonomy was so different 100, 200, or 300 years ago that one safe scientific/philosophical inference is that our current taxonomy will be radically different in 100 years.</li>

 <b>, Objection 9:&nbsp;, Science departments are not in the same building as university philosophy departments.</b> 
<ul>
<li> This is true but not strictly speaking an objection.&nbsp;</li>
<li> If my argument is correct, and the traditional classification of knowledge more accurate, then biologists and ethicists will again work in the same department.&nbsp;</li>

<ul> 
<li>As many have rightly observed, Mackie's argument would exclude metaphysics, math, and logic from the honorific title 'science' as well. But, as I argued above, if math and logic are formal sciences then so are metaphysics and ethics; if math and logic are not sciences then biology and paleontology can't be scientific.</li>

 <b>, Objection 12:&nbsp;, But Wikipedia says science is different from philosophy.</b> 
<ul>
<li> No, it doesn't. Philosophy is listed as a "formal" science.</li>
<li> Needless to say, Wikipedia can be <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2131458/Up-articles-Wikipedia-contain-factual-errors.html">wrong.</a></li>
<li> But also, even despite&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CircularReason">my tireless work to the contrary</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiscience">Wikipedia displays a scientistic bias.</a></li>
<li> Finally, Wikipedia gets the history of natural science pretty much correct. The only thing it gets wrong is the article on so called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science#Modern_science">modern science</a>" and "the" (one single, solitary) scientific method -- which it immediately admits is a body of&nbsp;<i>methods</i>.</li>

 <b>, Objection 13:&nbsp;, Science achieves consensus, or increasing convergence on truth; philosophy does not achieve such consensus.</b>

<ul> 
<li>Within a school of thought, practitioners of a specific discipline agree with each other; across schools of thought, practitioners of a specific discipline disagree with each other. This is just as true of physics as metaphysics, just as true of ethics as logic. There are more than 2,400 years of Aristotelian virtue ethicists who all have achieved consensus about the nature of the good and the importance of virtues and the definition of virtue.</li>
</ul>
 


 
 <b> </b>

 
 <b>, Objection 14:&nbsp;, The argument that philosophy is a science is needless "science-envy" on the part of professional academic philosophers.&nbsp;</b>

 
 <b> </b>
  
<ul>
<li> Ad hominem, appeal to motive, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulverism">Bulvernism</a>.</li>
<li> I don't envy science. Unlike McGinn, I prefer the mellifluous and ancient word "philosopher" much better than the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127037417">barbaric neologism "scientist."</a>&nbsp;The former has a beautiful sound and meaning and is 2,400 words old and no worse for wear; the latter is 176 years old and no better than when it started.</li>
<li> Also, calling the speaker of an argument "envious" is an ad hominem and fallacy of relevance. The motive does not determine the truth or falsity but the content of the argument.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>


 
 <b>, Objection 15:&nbsp;, Science is descriptive and predictive; philosophy is (or can be) evaluative and prescriptive.&nbsp;
</b> 
<ul> <b> 
<li>This is a true distinction between different kinds of sciences. But the objection mistakenly assumes that one or the other is not a science.&nbsp;</li>
</b></ul>
 <b>
 
</b>

 
 <b>, Objection 16: &nbsp;, There is some overlap between the two, as in&nbsp;<a href="http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/philosophy" style="font-family: times new roman, helvetica, sans-serif;">the philosophy of science</a>, &nbsp;and a "scientific" study of philosophical problems. But neither is a subset of the other.</b> 
  
 
<ul>
<li> This is an excellent objection. Identifying the overlap between (our current incoherent definitions of) science and philosophy helps us to see the conceptual "slippage" that results from thinking the issue through. Philosophy of science is part of every science, insofar as biologists and ethicists not only do their work but also reflect on what exactly their work is.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

 
 <b>Objection 17: But you're crazy.&nbsp;</b>

 
<ul>
<li> Ad hominem.&nbsp;</li>
<li> Circular reasoning.</li>
<li> True, but irrelevant.&nbsp;</li>
<li> Actually, you're the one who is crazy. (<i>To quoque;&nbsp;</i>circular reasoning; true, but irrelevant)</li>
</ul>

  

 
<h2>
 5. Conclusion</h2>
 <a href="http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2011/02/can-we-make-sense-of-world.html">Reality is partially knowable to us.</a> All knowledge we have acquired as individuals and a species is science. All knowledge we have acquired as individuals and a species is philosophy. 
  
 Distinctions between disciplines based on subject matter, methods, professional associations, or distinctions between formal and material disciplines, theoretical and practical disciplines, etc. do not eradicate the underlying unity of the world and the underlying unity of our knowledge.  
  
 As Harris says:&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 30px;">The remedy for all this confusion is simple: We must abandon the idea that science is distinct from the rest of human rationality. When you are adhering to the highest standards of logic and evidence, you are thinking scientifically. And when you’re not, you’re not." 
<h2>
 
Application</h2>
 What do we do about this? 
  
 I think first we should invite university science departments and philosophy departments to discuss these conceptual and taxonomy issues. 
  
 Second, if some are persuaded, we should re-fashion secondary school "science" textbooks to include more history of science and philosophy and to include more contemporary science and philosophy. 
  
 Third, biologists, physicists, metaphysicians, ethicists, logicians, etc. should attend at least a few of the same conferences, compare the state of the eart of each discipline, and break down ideological barriers that prevent conversation. Fourth, up and coming scientist/philosophers should keep their head in more than one branch of science/philosophy so that their papers, theses, and dissertations reflect the real, undivided nature of knowledge and the world.

<li>, &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 16.08px;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;times&quot; First, is there an important difference between physics/chemistry/biology on one side and metaphysics/ethics/epistemology on the other? Second, do we want to use the term "science" as a term which applies to all of these, or which applies to physics/chemistry/biology but not metaphysics/chemistry/biology. When you talk about the demarcation problem, I worry that you're trying to argue that because there's no deep or well-defined line which puts physics/etc on one side and metaphysics/etc on the other, that "science" must either be super restrictive or super inclusive. I just don't think that's how words work. On the other hand, sometimes it sounds like you think that even if there were an important difference between (say) physics and philosophy, that we should still think of these as two specific sciences, rather than one science and one non-science. Again, this just seems to me like a mistake about language—"science" refers to physics/etc and not to metaphysics because that's how everybody (more or less) uses it.&nbsp;</li>
<li>, &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 16.08px;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;times&quot; My first instinct would be to call science a subset of philosophy, rather than the other way around. Morality is a domain of philosophy, but that domain holds no overlap with science.</li>
<li>, &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 16.08px;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;times&quot; Well, I thought the only reason it wasn't considered a science was because we dropped "natural" off of natural science and just started using language badly. But I didn't that that change was intentional. I just thought that each generation gets worse and worse at using language and, consequently here we are not understanding anything because no one agrees on terms. Lol. But yea. Pretty sure philosophy has always been fairly methodical pursuit of knowledge which might make it a science.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;times&quot; &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 16.08px;">I think you are sort of right... but you need to make clear that you distinguish science and natural science. the study of abstracta seems definitely not in the realm of natural science.&nbsp;, &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 16.08px;">I think most of what you are going to run up against is that this is an outdated way of using the word "science" and that the words "science" and "philosophy" get used differently when we use them to indicate an activity: "doing science" and "doing philosophy."&nbsp;, &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 16.08px;">In these cases, you clearly don't "do" the totality of human knowledge. You use certain more or less well defined methods in order to try to understand or add to the totality of human knowledge. I think this usage properly distinguishes the two.&nbsp;, &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 16.08px;">Another thing though... science tends to aim at what is actually true. for example: biology is worried about how actually living organisms function. Metaphysics I would argue is not worried about how things actually are, but how things might have been (the actual world is clearly a way things might have been); limning the limits of metaphysical space. So it might be argued that science and metaphysics at least have different domains because they aim at different things. Science aims at understanding what actually is the case. Metaphysics aims at understanding what could have been the case.</li>
