Reading Guide
-------------


General Note:  The general rule in applied ethics is: examples, examples, and more examples.  If you can’t come up with an original example of each concept, you probably do not know it well enough yet.  So, come see me.  And definitely form study groups.  

Also, I do not claim that these questions are comprehensive.  But they should give you a good guide to what is most important.  And make sure that you also understand the things that were in the lectures/discussions but not in the readings.

These notes are borrowed with a few additions and emendations from Jacob Affolter's version of the course taught in the Fall of 2012.



## Ciulla, "In Praise of Nepotism?" ##

**Take Away Quote:**

> Bellow contends that Americans have an extreme antipathy to
> nepotism. He says, "Nepotism has been judged harshly in light of our
> ideological view that we 'ought' to love humanity more than our
> family, that we 'ought' to value efficiency and merit over personal
> loyalty, or that we ought to make it on our own instead of accepting
> help from relatives or friends. The truth is, very few people do
> this."
