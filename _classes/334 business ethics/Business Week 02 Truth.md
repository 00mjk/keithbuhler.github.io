What is Kreeft's basic thesis? That truth is real and objective. That it is possible to know what's what, and that no skeptical challenge to that possibility can stand up to scrutiny.

#  W Aug-31  Basic Philosophy: Peter Kreeft, Moral Relativism

Is the moral law unreal or real? Are rules like "human beings do not steal" just as real as "apples grow on apple trees"?

# # F       Sep-2   Basic Ethics: Religion & Reason  


Most people are religious; that is, they adhere to a particular religious tradition and/or they believe that the universe was created or sustained by God. Religion and ethics have a complex relationship. 

I don't need to see a show of hands: but probably about 2 in 10 of us in this room are non-religious or unaffiliated, while about 8 are affiliated with a particular religious tradition. 

Religion and ethics have a complex relationship. Today I'd like to get expectations and context right. First, I'll go over some statistics you may not know about religious adherence. Then, I'll apply some of these demographic statistics to business. Then I'll explain one of the most common ways religion affects ethics and therefore business ethics.  

How many people are religious?
How many people are secular?
How many people are immoral?
How many people are moral?

1. Statistics 

In the US Today: 

68% Christian
10% other religious affiliation 
22% unaffiliated total
including atheists (5-8%), agnostics, humanists, 
and “spiritual but not religious” nones (5-8%). 

TOTAL: 
78% Religious 
22% non-Religious

In general, 7 out of 10 people are religious. 
In general, 2 out of 10 people are unaffiliated, spiritual, agnostic, or atheist. 

Exceptions: 
Academia (50% religious)
Philosophy (15% religious)
Science (42% religious)
Entertainment industry?
News Media?

Compare with: The Czech Republic, 21% of people are religious. Sweden and Denmark have 17%-18%, Japan is 31% atheist. America has 5%-15% atheists

So how does this affect business? Some businesses are composed of mostly religious people; some are composed of mostly secular people. Some businesses take a public stand on religion. Others don't. 


US Business: 
Chick Fil A
Tyson
Forever 21
Mary Kay
Alaska Airlines
Hobby Lobby
Tom’s 
Salvation Army
AA

Non-religious:
Starbucks
Popeye’s
Michael’s
GoodWill
Rational Recovery

But when it comes to their ethics, most people take some cues from their religion. 

Divine Command Theory is the view that morality in some way depends on God or the divine. The straightforward version of Divine Command Theory is the Judeo-Christian version where God tells his people how to live and what not to do. That is not the only version, however. It might be that we know how to live and what not to do even without divine commands; but that god gives commands for other reasons than knowledge, such as encouragement. 

Michael Austin says: 

"A strong version of Divine Command Theory includes the claim that moral statements (x is obligatory) are defined in terms of theological statements (x is commanded by God). At the other end of the spectrum is the view that the commands of God are coextensive with the demands of morality. God’s commands do not determine morality, but rather inform us about its content."

(i) God in some sense determines what is moral; (ii) moral obligations are derived from God’s commands, where these commands are understood as statements of the revealed divine will.

## Possible advantages of Divine Command Theory

1. Immanuel Kant argues that "we must believe that God exists because the requirements of morality are too much for us to bear. We must believe that there is a God who will help us satisfy the demands of the moral law. With such a belief, we have the hope that we will be able to live moral lives." (Austin)
2.  That is, if the origin of the universe is a personal moral being, then the existence of objective moral truths are at home, so to speak, in the universe. By contrast, if the origin of the universe is non-moral, then the existence of such truths becomes philosophically perplexing, because it is unclear how moral properties can come into existence via non-moral origins.

## Possible disadvantages of Divine Command Theory
1. The motive for being moral might become merely to avoid punishment or gain bliss. 
2. Eutyphro Dilmemma

We ought to love one another because God commands us to do so.  (What if he commands something immoral?) 

Or

God commands us to love one another because that is what we ought to do. (Moral goodness is independent of God, and he is subject to it)
