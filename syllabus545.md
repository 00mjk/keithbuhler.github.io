### Course Description: 

This course is a survey of central topics in the philosophy of religion, including faith and reason, religious experience, the existence of God, miracles, revelation, the problem of evil, providence and foreknowledge, survival after death, religious language, and religious diversity.  Readings will be drawn primarily from contemporary authors and will focus on western theism, although there will also be some attention to eastern religions.  After reading a variety of articles on the aforementioned topics, we will read a recent monograph dealing with arguments for the existence of God, *Natural Signs and Knowledge of God* by C. Stephen Evans.

Our goals are: 

* To become familiar with current controversies and topics in philosophy of religion;
* To examine several arguments for and against the existence of God, for and against atheism, and to examine religious experiences and miracle testimonies, to examine religious language, and the relationship between faith and reason.
* To develop a thoughtful, rational, Christian world-view
