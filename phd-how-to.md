title: how to get a phd in philosophy
--- 

[Another page explains my research.](/phd) This post gives some advice on each stage of the process. 

### My Story  ###

In 2011, my wife and I decided to pursue a PhD in philosophy. We had just gotten married in 2010. I was finishing an M.A. in theology. I was working as a high school teacher and she was the admissions department at a new college. I knew for five years I wanted to pursue further graduate training, but now the timing was right.

We applied to 14 schools. I got 10 rejections, and 4 acceptances. U.K. was my top choice because I wanted to work with David Bradshaw, but the choice was easy. Claremont and University of Chicago offered no funding, no tuition; University of Dallas offered tuition with no funding; University of Kentucky offered tuition with funding. I accepted the offer. 

## Do you want to go to graduate school?

This is the difficult discernment decision. Why go to grad school? [There are almost no jobs in philosophy.](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2015/02/pedigree-matters-and-prospective-students-are-entitled-to-know.html) In my opinion, you should only go to graduate school if you cannot imagine being happy doing anything else except philosophy. 

Ask your teachers for an honest appraisal of your current ability and potential. Academic philosophy has room for all kinds of interests and abilities, but you don't want to kid yourself. 

Some study philosophy and go on to other things. Some get a B.A. or even an M.A. before going into business, non-profit, or ministry. Others go "all the way" with a PhD and try to teach at a university. 


### 2. If so, MA or PHD? ##

[MAs, in general, leverage you up to better PhD programs (if you do well).](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/terminal-vs-non-terminal-ma-programs.html)  But they extend your total time to job market from average 7 years to average 9 years. The end goal is to learn a lot, hone your writing, get good recommendations (for PhD applications) or move on to your career. 

[PhDs, in general, get you on the job market in average 7 years.](http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf06312/) They often pay you to teach or research along the way. The end goal is to become a professor and/or researcher at a university. 

### 3. How do you best apply? ##

Your philosophical essay is the most important. Pick your best undergrad or MA essay, re-write it twice, polish it, send it to your favorite and most generous professor, re-write it again, pay someone to proof-read it for you, make the corrections, then print it out and read it aloud with a red pen. Find errors in grammar, typing, or thinking, and re-write it again...  THEN include it in your portfolio.

The [GRE](http://www.ets.org/gre) is necessary, but not life or death. Philosophers tend to do well on the math. But you should study harder for the verbal and writing, as this counts more than math. (Math is more important for, say, engineering grad students). 

[Personal statements?](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2007/09/advice-on-perso.html) Not sure how important they are. No one has ever told me they *make* a candidate; but it seems commonsense that they can *break* a candidate. Play it safe -- just be calm, be yourself, be frank, and say what you want to study. Your aspirations will change; just state what you want to study *today*. 


### 4. Once you get in, how do you best make progress? ###
At U. Kentucky, there are 35 steps from admission to "congratulations Doctor". So I've [made a list.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RqZIRaApZnbUcbipRMALKwz1FTuKLeRoB529OZpdbeA/edit?usp=sharing)

The list is 35 or so items, broken into 6 (very disproportionally sized) projects: 

1. Complete 12 classes.                                                2 years

2. Complete language, logic, and Comprehensive exams 2-3 years

3. Write and defend an Area Proposal.                          6 months

4. Write and defend three Qualifying Exams.                 3 weeks

5. Write and defend a Dissertation Proposal.                 6 months?

6. Write and defend a Dissertation.                                2 years




### 5. How do you approach coursework? ##


The first step was to complete my coursework. I took 2-3 classes per semester for 2.5 years. 

My approach is to hit hard early, and ease up later. I took three classes (two seminars) the first semester. This was hard, but you adjust to the work load. Manage your time. It's like jumping in a cold pool head first. You adjust quicker. 

I took three seminars the third semester and that got me ahead, which has been nice. 

My program requires a "Teaching Proseminar" to help us be good little graduate TA proletariat wage slaves. I did that the first semester too. My professor made a throw-away class something actually useful. 



### 6. Language, Logic, and Comprehensive exams? ##

Pick the language in which you will eventually read primary sources: usually either Greek, Latin, French, or German -- but of course sometimes Spanish, or whatever language you might be working in. Also, U. Kentucky requires symbolic logic, so I took that my third year. 

Comprehensive exams are required at U. Kentucky but the practice is fading. I studied for a whole semester or summer before the test, reading primary sources and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Internet Encyclopedias of Philosophy. Rest well on the day of the exam, bring snacks, pace yourself, and write like the wind. 



### 7. How do you decide on an Area? ##

Naturally, each school is different. Some have you write a Prospectus or Dissertation Proposal rather than stretching the process out like U. K. does. We do an Area Proposal, then Qualifying Exams, then a Dissertation Proposal, each of which must be written and orally defended before the committee. 

My area proposal was the product of much soul-searching. When I applied to graduate school, I had intended to study Plato. However, my favorite themes in contemporary ethics and metaethics kept cropping up. Every semester I wrote a term paper or three for my courses. In these papers, I noticed that I kept gravitating towards attacking or defending metaphysical naturalism, ethical naturalism, and so on. 

I asked my advisor if I should go ahead and make the switch from AOS (area of speciality) Ancient Philosophy to AOS Ethics. He agreed. At that point, I started writing-to-discover. I wrote several drafts of potential area proposals for my eyes only. I narrowed down my interests and honed my arguments. I read widely about naturalism in its various forms, and about the controversies between naturalists and non-naturalists in ethics. 

### 7b How do you write the Area Proposal? 

I asked several friends for copies of their successfully defended Area Proposals and also downloaded some random examples from the web. They were all quite different. I decided to go ahead and attempt a draft of a formal, complete proposal. 

After several iterations, in conversation with my advisor, I had a complete draft. Looking back, I see that it wasn't very good -- I still didn't have a grasp of how slippery some of the vocabulary is: terms like "objective", "naturalism", "metaethics", and so on have a wide range of nuanced and sometimes competing meanings. But I had the Area, and that's the point. 

Now I was able to begin researching in my area in order to pass the "qualifying exams" 

## 7c Research

I started reading in force. I downloaded articles from PhilPapers or JSTOR and purchased or checked out books by a few of my favorite authors: John McDowell, Philippa Foot, Alasdair MacIntyre, Iris Murdoch, Rosalind Hursthouse, Alan Gibbard, Michael Thompson, and so on. I read, took notes, and occassionaly attempted the foolhardy task of writing a whole chapter draft. These drafts were pretty universally junk, but writing them helped me think things through. 


### 8. How do you pass the Qualifying Exams? ##

This is simply a matter of doing the reading in your area. Take notes as you go -- quotations (with full citation information or you will regret it!) and sentences or paragraphs in your own words. These many, many notes will serve as raw material when you begin writing exams and chapters. 


### 10. How do you write a dissertation? ##

[Start by reading this awesome instruction set from Proffessor Robert Paul Wolff](http://robertpaulwolff.blogspot.com/2010/07/how-to-write-doctoral-dissertation-in.html)

The plan right now is to write one page per day, every day, 7 days a week, until draft 1 is done. "Done" df = 6 chapters, 40 pages each, 12,000 words each, for 72,000 words total and about 280 pages.


One good structure idea:

* 4-6 chapters
+ 30-50 pages each
+ 120-300 pages total. 
+ 8,000 - 12,000 words or so per chapter
+ 50,000-62,000 words total. 

This would look like: 

+ Chapter 1:  Introduction, thesis, key premises, assumptions, methodology, flow of arguments, and outline of dissertation
+ Chapter 2: Literature review; background on your topic/authors.
+ Chapter 3: Arguments 1
+ Chapter 4: Arguments 2
+ Chapter 5: Arguments 3, etc
+ Chapter 6: Conclusion - Reminder of thesis, summary of arguments.



#### A bit more detail ###
A bit more detail: Your dissertation will be between 150-300 pages long. It will be minimum 4 chapters, maximum probably 8. Each chapter will be minimum 20 pages, maximum 80 pages. Each chapter will be minimum 10,000 words, maximum 20,000 words. Then you are done. 

Example 1 - 250 pages, 6 chapters, 41 pages each, 10,020 words per chapter. 

Example 2 - 200 pages, 5 chapters, 40 pages each, 10,000 words per chapter.

Example 3 - 300 pages, 5 chapters, 60 pages each, 15,000 words per chapter. 

Example 4 - 300 pages, 8 chapters, 37 pages each, 9,200 words per chapter.

Example 5 - 180 pages, 10 chapters, 18 pages each, 4,500 words per chapter.

Example 6 - 200 pages, 10 chapters, 20 pages each, 5,000 words per chapter

### Boot Camp!


16 May 2016.  My university began hosting a "Boot Camp" writing retreat. We have a private dorm room on campus, unlimited snacks (both healthy and unhealthy snacks, woo hoo!), an endless supply of coffee and soda, and the comforting presence of a  community of 40 or so fellow writers. 

The Boot Camp is two weeks long. We each commit to write at least 4 hours a day, Monday through Friday, for those two weeks. It's a time to write, revise, struggle, get confused, commiserate, write more, take breaks, and break through. 

It's been awesome. Though tomorrow is the last day. Sad!

Here's what I've gotten done: 

My process is rather messy. Each chapter goes through a stage: (1) draft, (2) revised draft, (3) polished draft, (4) submitted to advisor and approved or revised again. 

Chapters 1 and 2 were already at stage (4), approved by advisor. 

Chapter 3 was revised and is now polished.
Chapter 4 was drafted and is now revised.
Chapter 5 was drafted and is now revised.
Chapter 6 was drafted and is now revised. 
Chapter 7 is drafted and I'm revising today and tomorrow. 

After that, I only have one more chapter (plus the conclusion)! 

Then I will go back and polish 4-8. Then I will submit 4-8 one by one to my advisor, and revise some more.
