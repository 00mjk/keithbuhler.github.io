##### WEEK 1: What is Health Care Ethics?

Jan 13-May 6. 
Spring break March 14-19.
Finals week is May 2-6. 

| Date      |      Due |      Topic       |     Description       |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
|Wed Aug 26 | (No reading due) |  Syllabus | Today, we get to know each other. And we identify expectations for this class. What can you hope to get out of it? What do I expect of your reading, writing, and discussions? Make sure to buy your book, download the handouts. Also, review this syllabus. Then start reading! 3x5 cards for names; Form groups 1-10. |  
|Fri Aug 28|  Read *Bioethics* 1-25 and do reading Quiz 1 |  Health Care, Bioethics, and Philosophy. | Study this long, interesting introduction. Take the long quiz. What is the purpose of health care? Philosophy and critical thinking can help in defining health care and deciding on hard cases. Does healthcare have an end (a purpose, a point)? Yes. I’ll present some options and argue what the purpose is. Is that end to provide for patient health (objective) or to satisfy patient preference (subjective)? To prevent patient sickness and death (negative) or to promote patient health (positive)? Does cosmetic surgery fall under this definition of healthcare?  We’ll use these considerations as an introduction to philosophical analysis, and group discussion. |
| Mon Aug 31 |    Plato’s Apology handout (20 pages):    Life, Death, and Devouring Time. 
Reading Quiz 2. 
Before we dive into the textbook, let’s think about life in general. ‘Devouring time’ means that death comes for all. How do we live well in light of this fact? Socrates is an example: Socrates’ death is upon him. He is being sentenced for practicing annoying philosophy, for “believing in new gods” and for “corrupting the youth.” Also, with Socrates’ martyrdom, philosophy is born. His teaching is that we should care more for the soul than the body. Still, the body is important.  Health care ethics is about caring for the body but also involves psychology, politics, and religion. The Apology is a dramatic introduction to the importance of critical thinking in all these areas, and a persuasive defense of  “soul care”. 


W Sept 2:      “Truth” and “Relativism” Handouts (6 pages):  Science, Religion, and Truth. 
Reading Quiz 3. 
The problem of disagreement arises when we notice that people disagree about what is true, real, good, or beautiful. Is there any right answer? What is truth? Is it objective? Since we are seeking truth all semester, we must consider the best arguments for and against the existence of objective truth, especially in light of the “problem of disagreement.” Today’s session will challenge your presuppositions. It is absolutely necessary for our shared inquiry this semester that we all follow reason both as a procedure and a doctrine. 

Unit Paper 1 prompt: What is your health care code? (due next Wed, Sept 9)
Check the “Unit Papers” Handout online for detailed instructions. Do not attempt to write this paper before reading the detailed instructions. 

F Sept 4:   “Goodness” Handout (10 pages):  The Tao. 
Reading Quiz 4.  (optional) Fill out “Get to know you survey”
First we will go over how to do Critical Reading and Group Presentation assignments. Then we’ll discuss “the Tao.” Is morality relative to a culture or tradition? We will examine the evidence for and against the claim that morality is objective and universal for all people. The “hard cases” make it seem relative, but the “easy cases” make it seem absolute. Examine the “Illustrations of the Tao” handout to see what common moralities cross time and space and culture. (Then read the “Common Morality” handout of Buchamp and Childress for their take on the Tao.) Then read the Kreeft “Is the Moral Law Objective?” handout. Are these arguments persuasive? How does the Tao square with your own tradition (whether religious, secular, or other)? For this semester, we will proceed on the claim that some moral laws are objective, binding, and good. But how can we deepen our knowledge of our own tradition and our understanding of others’?

Reading Quiz 6. 
This will be one of few Fridays that is not a discussion day. Because of labor day, we’ll begin a conversation about the doctor-patient relationship. What are the doctor’s obligations? The patient’s obligations? Does a doctor have “power” and if so how should it be wielded? Is cosmetic surgery within the purview of medicine?

SDistinguish the whole-brain, higher-brain, and brain-stem criteria of death. Do you find Bernat’s support for the whole-brain formulation over the other two criteria persuasive? In the final analysis, Bernat’s support for the whole-brain formulation rests on its public policy success, in spite of its biological and philosophical shortcomings. Is Bernat’s position ethically justified? 

**Updated**W Sept 23:   Unit Paper 2: (Health care provider majors:) Would you ever deceive a patient? Why or why not? (Non-provider majors:) Would you ever want the doctor to deceive you? Why or why not?

Voluntary Euthanasia: A Utilitarian Perspective (206-213) — Lecture. 
Should the rule against killing apply to the competent person who determines that it would be better to die? From a utilitarian perspective, does it make sense to limit euthanasia to terminally or incurably ill patients? Is the slippery slope argument against euthanasia convincing? 

W Sep 30:   Bioethics 213-227 (14 pp): Wolf, Gender, Feminism, and Death (217-227) — Group 8
Reading Quiz 12
How might gender dynamics impact PAS and euthanasia?  Are women more vulnerable than are men for nonvoluntary PAS and euthanasia? Is a rights framework an appropriate way to approach PAS and euthanasia? What does feminist analysis add to the ethical debate? 
Keown, End of Life: the Buddhist View (213-217) — Lecture. Because Buddhism lacks a central authority, could Buddhist values be used to by individual buddhists to justify euthanasia? Would it be possible to aim at death while also being compassionate?

F Oct 2:    Bioethics 239-245 (6 pp):  Discussion
Slow Medicine — if a 90 year old patient has not communicated her preferences, would slow medicine be in her best interest? Anybody in there? — In writing your own living will, how would Owen’s findings influence your instructions to others regarding your treatment should you be diagnosed with PVS?

W Oct 7:    Bioethics 265-290 (25 pp): Thomson, A Defense of Abortion — Group 9. 
Reading Quiz 13. 
Many pro-lifers assume that if a fetus is a human being, then abortion is wrong. Thomson assumes a fetus is a human and argues that abortion can still be acceptable.

M Oct 19:   Bioethics 371-382 AND 386-395, Introduction & Daniels, Justice, Health, and Health Care — Group 1
Access to health care, rationing, medical justice, organizational ethics, and organ transplant. How much should individual health care cost, and can it be free? Who should pay for it — individuals, insurance, government, charities? 
If healthcare is “special,” what makes it so? Should efforts to ensure justice in health outcomes focus on social conditions in addition to access to health care? Will following Daniel’s four conditions ensure justice in the allocating of health care resources?
Reading Quiz 15 is for the birds.

W Oct 21:   Bioethics 396-404 (8): Engelhardt, Rights to Health Care Allocations — Group 2
Is Engelhardt correct that humans do not share a common view of justice and beneficence? Are the natural and social lotteries as readily distinguishable as Engelhardt claims? Should the unfortunate also have a right to health care? Should the unfortunate also have a right to receive health care? What are the advantages and disadvantages of Engelhardt’s “Proposed diverse health care packages”? Engelhardt lauds “open democratic dialogue” as a way to “fashion a basic package of healthcare for all citizens.” How does this notion compare with Daniels for procedural justice conditions for distributing healthcare?
Reading Quiz 16.

F Oct 23:   Bioethics 477-482 (5):  Discussion on Health Care
Case 1, Health of Nations. Based upon these comparisons, does the U. S. healthcare system seem unjust? Case 2, the “Commonwealth” of MA. Do you think MA’s healthcare plan is just?  Case 3, Should Illegal Immigrants Have Access to Care? Do illegal immigrants (ii) have a right to health care? Do health care facilities have a duty to provide it? or is providing such care praiseworthy but not required?  Case 4, Blue Cross Seeks Physician information 1. Bluecross was asking physicians to be gatekeepers of medical resources. Is it appropriate for doctors to take on that role?  Case 5, Age-Based Rationing. 1. do you think it is just to ration healthcare on the basis of age rather than relative need? And more! 

WEEK 10: Getting Health Care II 
M Oct 26: Bioethics 412-419 (7): James Dwyer, Illegal Immigrants, Social Responsibility—Group 3
Dwyer argues that our attitude toward and treatment of illegal or undocumented immigrants should not be viewed through the lense of desert nor professional ethics, but “social responsibility”.  Is desert the appropriate material criterion of justice for access to healthcare? Would California's proposition 187 justly or unjustly denied healthcare to illegal immigrants? Is social ethics easily distinguishable from bioethics? What is the social responsibility of United States regarding illegal immigrants?
Reading Quiz 17. 

W Oct 28:   Bioethics 460-464 (4): Barbro Bjorkman — Donate but not sell? — Group 4
Barbro Bjorkman observes that we intuitively judge it to be wrong to sell our organs, but right to donate them. She offers an explanation based on reflection of what the virtuous person would do — the person who is courageous and generous. 1. Do the arguments supporting organ sales correlate with your moral intuitions? 2. Is it possible to be a virtuous person and not being organ donor? 3. Are there any situations where virtuous person might sell rather than donate organs? 4. What can be done to increase your society's sense of virtue? What is the probability that such projects will be successful?

M Nov 2:    Bioethics 487-502 (15):       Clinical Research 
Clinical research is a key part of biomedical advances to cure or prevent diseases and improve people’s quality of life. The “cost” of such research is more than dollars. People, animals, stem cells are the objects of most controversial clinical research. Today, we explore the landscape of clinical research and the bioethical boundaries. We research on (1) humans, (2) human stem cells, and (3) animals. What are the limits on research and the benefits? 
Reading Quiz 19

W Nov 4:  Bioethics 507-515 (8):  “The Nuremberg Code” and “Belmont Report” — Group 5
The Nuremberg Code came out of the Nuremberg trials of Nazi doctors. It is like the Belmont Report, which initiated a new era of biomedical or health care ethics. Is this document on the right track? Completely right? In need of correction? Completely off? How does the report distinguish between practice and research? Why is the first principle formulated as “respect for persons” and not “respect for autonomy”?  What two moral rules are embedded in the principle of beneficence? 4. How would you describe the methodological framework of the Report (refer to chapter 1 in this text for help)? 
Reading Quiz 20

Bioethics 537-544 (8):     Monitoring Stem Cell Research (Group 6/lecture)
Presidential Council on Bioethics. What are embryonic stem cells, and what is their potential scientific and medical value? What broader moral issues underlie the debate about stem cell research? Why is the term “embryo” problematic? Why is “moral status” problematic? What are the core moral issues in embryonic stem cell research? 

Bioethics 544-556 (12): Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cell Research — (Lecture) 
Consider these Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and other testimonies on stem cell research. Where do the various religions agree? Where do they disagree? Which (if any) of these considerations are applicable to public policy? 
Reading Quiz 21


W Nov 11:   Bioethics 556-564 (8):     Ethics of Animal Research — Group 7

Reading Quiz 22

F Nov 13:   Bioethics 576-580 (4):     Discussion
Is stem cell research on “dead” embryos any better than live ones? Should apes be subject to protection from research? Rats?

Bioethics 639-646 (7) —  Davis, Genetic Dilemmas, Child’s Rights — Group 9
How does Davis want to reconceive the moral conflict faced by genetic counselors working with parents who want to have a child with a disability? What does a child’s right to an open future encompass? 
Quiz 23

F Nov 20:   Bioethics 598-606 (8):  Sandel, The Case Against Perfection — Group 10
What is wrong with designer children, bionic athletes? What is the notion of “giftedness”? How valuable is it? Sandel argues that humility, openness, reverence, beholding are values at stake in our “intoxicated” drive for total mastery over ourselves and our children. What is the value of these things, and how do they balance against the values of mastery, dominion, and molding? 

Discussion: Is there human nature? Will technology help us transcend it? Is technology evolving now the way biology has been evolving before? Do cultural differences make a big deal?

Optional Guardian article on Calico.

F Nov 20 Unit Paper 5: Comparing research on fetal organs with research on animals, are both wrong or both right, or one right and the other wrong? Why? 

WEEK 14: The Environmental Turn 
M Nov 23:   Bioethics 661-667, 670-674  (10)  Introduction; Wendell Berry “Health is Membership”
Barry argues that health is not a possession of individuals but of communities. And not just communities. The health of soil, animal, and human is inextricably bound together in one whole. He argues against the mechanistic analogy of the heart as “a pump” and the mind as “a computer,” and shows how the false assumption harms patients in hospitals. Food and rest are essential to health yet are ignored in hospital settings. Berry ends with a series of questions. Try your best to think about the answers
