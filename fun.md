Hi! Welcome to my personal site. 

I'm a husband, father, [philosopher](/), [educator](/teaching), speaker, and [writer](http://www.amazon.com/Sola-Scriptura-Dialogue-Keith-Buhler-ebook/dp/B009N27L12/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1401301911&sr=8-9&keywords=sola+scriptura). (You can check out my [philosophy site](/) for my academic work.) 

This site hosts some random fun projects I'm working on.
