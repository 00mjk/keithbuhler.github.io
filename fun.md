# Keith Buhler's Fun Things

<img src="/img/midair.jpg" alt="Mid-air" hspace="5" align="right" width="40%">


Hi! Welcome to my personal site. I'm a husband, father, [philosopher](/), [educator](/teaching), speaker, [writer](http://www.amazon.com/Sola-Scriptura-Dialogue-Keith-Buhler-ebook/dp/B009N27L12/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1401301911&sr=8-9&keywords=sola+scriptura).  

[The Buhler Report](/blog) is my new blog offering thoughtful dialogue on timeless philosophical ideas and recent current events.  I discuss the fun, the serious, and the politically charged -- but I would rather discuss intelligently than agree. 

Also, I help people [read intentionally](http://www.readingintentionally.com), get to know the Oxford [Inklings](http://www.inklings.info/), practice peaceful [meditation](/meditation), or I just tell [stories.](/writings) Some of these projects are complete, but others are in development. (You can check out my [philosophy site](/) for my academic work.)
