I'm currently a PhD candidate in philosophy at the [University of Kentucky](/Buhler-CV) and a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. I've been a full-time [teacher](/teaching) in universities and classical high schools for 8 years and love what I do. I use immersive Socratic dialogue, real books, and humor to [introduce folks](/students) to the great conversation. 

I'm just about done with that dissertation. My [research](/research) centers on the neo-Aristotelian account of nature and normativity. When Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre all weigh in on the relation between human nature and human virtue, facts and values, science and ethics -- I mostly defend Foot.   

What is philosophy for? Academic research, certainly. But also human flourishing. In my spare time, I like creating [art](/art), editing Wikipedia, YouTubing, and [composing lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) of what I do in my spare time.
