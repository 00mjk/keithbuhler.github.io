# Abolish Insurance

## Mission

AbolishInsurance.org is a non-profit company dedicated to persuading the next generation of policy-makers, consumers, and entrepreneurs that Americans ought to abolish private health insurance. 

The argument is simple: 

1. If the existence of the health insurance industry ultimately results in a *less* healthy and wealthy populus, then it needs to be abolished. 
2. The existence of the private health insurance industry results in a less healthy and wealthy populus. 

The first premise is a common sense pragmatic and moral proposition. Our common social and political goal is to create for ourselves as healthy and wealthy a populus as possible. The second premise is a factual one. Most people don't know that it is true. Most people believe that the existence of the private health insurance industry results in *more* people getting health care, and more people being healthy, than without it. But what if the second premise is true? 

The private health insurance industry needs to be abolished. 


## Objections

1. It seems that private health insurance covers people who cannot afford paying a doctor or hospital for care. 
2. Private health insurance prevents us from sliding towards socialism where the government pays doctors and hospitals on people's behalf.
3. The private health insurance industry has the effect of raising the salary of doctors, nurses, and health care providers, incentivizing people to pursue health care careers, increasing doctor satisfaction, and 



## Some exerpts from like minded folks

### Imagine
Imagine an America with no health insurance companies.

What do health insurance companies do?

They take as much money as possible from people who want health insurance coverage. They pay out as little money as possible — so-called medical loss — to settle claims from creditors for health services and products that have been delivered.


They keep as much money as possible for the incomes of their executives and other employees, and to enhance share value for their owners.

They do try to attract enough premium money from customers — so-called covered lives — so that they can spread the risk of a few high-cost customers across the premiums of many low-cost customers.

They try as much as they legally can to cover as many low-cost customers as possible, and to keep as many high-cost customers out of their plans in order to maximize revenues and minimize expense.

They do employ a lot of people, all “following the money” — sort of a jobs program.

Why do we need them? There must be a better way.

It is true that health insurance companies use market clout to attempt to “keep costs low.”

And they are motivated to try to keep their own costs low by limiting use of expensive procedures.

But, by any fair, rational, national, international, and outcome measure, health insurance companies have failed to keep utilization low and failed to keep costs low.

But they have succeeded splendidly at growing their workforces, paying their execs highly, and rewarding their shareholders handsomely.

The for-profit American health insurance industry — and many of those not-for-profit lookalikes — is a poster child for the triumph of poorly-regulated and misplaced capitalism in a historically fundamental service profession.

Why does the United States need health insurance companies at all?

The answer is we don’t, at least not in their current forms. They cause more harm than they do good.

There must be better way to use our national and personal resources more effectively and efficiently to keep our people healthy and manage their illnesses when they get sick.

Let’s create it.

### Abolish

**Abstract.** Health care financing can be based on one of two conflicting principles: health care as a right versus the insurance principle. The former assures equal access to care for all people regardless of income, while the latter requires each grouping in society to pay its own way. In the United States, health financing has utilized both principles, with employer-sponsored group health insurance approximating health care as a right. However, the insurance principle is increasingly eroding this right. In five major areas, the private health insurance industry has serious flaws: it has contributed to health care inflation; it wastes billions in administrative and marketing costs; it is unfair to many groups in society; it has undermined the positive features of health maintenance organization reform; and it has far too much political and economic power. In order to establish health care as a right as the guiding principle of U.S. health care financing, the private health insurance industry and the insurance principle should be abolished.
