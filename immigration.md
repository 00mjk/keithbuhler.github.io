# Immigration and the End of U.S. Conservative Tradition

**Thesis**: Mass, unchecked, legal and illegal immigration (from South American primarily, but also anywhere that isn't already westernized) has reached unprecedented levels. It is dangerous enough for the U.S. identity, economic, and electorate that dramatic action is needed now. 

**Objections**: We are a nation of immigrants; immigrants produce wealth by working; immigrants do jobs others don't want; immigrants start great companies like Google, etc. 

**Reply**:  Although we are a “nation of immigrants” or rather colonizers, they were almost universally European Christians who spoke English. The demographics of the U.S., despite waves of immigrants from all over the world during the late 1800s,the early 1900s has remained 80-90% native born English speaking whites and 10-15% native born English speaking blacks, with a few percentage points making up the rest. As of 2010 it is 72% native born English speaking white, 12% blacks, 17% Latinos (roughly 50 million) many of whom are not native born or don’t speak English. These estimates are arguably low.  

We are not talking about "immigration" as a whole. We are talking about unchecked, mass immigration. Not a few H1-B1 work visas from the smartest people in the world, but unchecked, legal and illegal mass immigration (millions and millions and millions every year). 

**Arguments.**

1. Before 1965, immigration has turned the country slightly but noticeably Left. (Obama beat Romney by less than 5 million votes). 
2. The two major issues for Republicans (jobs and national security) are both directly downstream from immigration, since the number of unemployed Americans is roughly equivalent to the number of illegal immigrants; and the majority of the last several dozen terrorist attacks, mass bombings, and mass shootings have been perpetrated by immigrants (legal and illegal). 
3. As in London, where entire areas no longer speak English, there are entire areas in the U.S. where no one speaks English, and where western civilization and American history is no longer taught. 
4. Hence, unchecked, mass immigration has and might continue to 
	(a) undermine American unity, identity, language, and culture 
	(b) irreversibly turns the political tide of the nation toward Democrats, 
	(c) bankrupt government entitlement programs, 
	(d) increase unemployment, and 
	through (a)-(d) irreversibly damage the United States as we know it. 
5. Every sovereign nation has the right to determine its demographic make up — and other countries, like Mexico, do not permit expired visa holders to remain and do not permit illegals to stay and work. We must do the same or risk our very identity.
