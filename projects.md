While teaching philosophy to upper school students at a classical school, I've been developing a [10th grade intro to philosophy course](http://www.keithbuhler.com/trinity-philosophy/). 

Earlier this year, I spoke at Trinity Classical Academy, introducing our community to the nature and value of philosophy. The talk is titled "Philosophy For Everyone" and you can watch the presentation here:

In summer of 2018, I spoke at [the ACCS conference on "Assessing for Virtue".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovzMF-znsN8&t=2394s) and received positive feedback from the 120 or so in attendance.  

Around the same time I also had the privilege of [interviewing Dr. Robert George of Princeton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfDdJiyDnaY&t=10s) for my YouTube channel. Before that, I did audio interviews with [Eric Silverman, David Bradshaw, and JP Moreland.](http://www.advicetochristianphilosophers.com/)

That same year, I joined the board of the Chesterton School of Liberal arts where I serve as Chief Academic Advisor. 

In 2017, I defended my philosophy dissertation, titled [Becoming What We Are](/phd). It defends Aristotle's ethics in light of scientific naturalism and offers a tendentious definition of scientific naturalism. 

In 2012, I published a my first book, *Sola Scriptura*, a [Platonic dialogue](http://bitly.com/ScriptureOrTradition) consisting of of various Christians discussing Scripture and Tradition. 

My most recent academic submission was revised and resubmitted in January to the Cambridge journal, *Religious Studies*. Meanwhile, in addition to blogging about various topics, I'm planning the groundwork of a book about classical education.
