## Course Description and Learning Outcomes ##

**From the Course Catalog:** A study of the philosophical works of Lewis dealing with arguments for the existence of God based on human rationality, the problem of suffering, objective truth, and relation to popular culture. Includes viewing and discussion of pertinent videos.

In this course, we will read a wide selection of C\. S\. Lewis's non-fiction works and two stories from the *Chronicles of Narnia*. Although Lewis was a philologist and not a philosopher by profession, much of his work deals with central issues in the philosophy of religion and his brilliant capacity to articulate central convictions of the Christian worldview has made him a spokesman for our faith. Further, a few of his arguments---notably those in *Miracles*---contribute genuinely new philosophical insights to the public square. We will have a chance this semester to read, evaluate, and critique both Lewis's articulation of old truths and his account of new insights.


The expected learning outcomes for this course are:
- to learn an appreciation for Lewis's contribution to the
  Western philosophical tradition.
- to understand the primary questions, terminology, and
  theories that present in Lewis's philosophical milieu.
- to learn to carefully read Lewis's texts with a critical
  eye.
- to gain the capacity to communicate difficult philosophical thoughts
  in clear, concise prose.
- to connect the Lewis's writing with ones own faith.

The largest portion of your grade will come from in-class discussion which I will evaluate on the basis of pluses, checks, and minuses recorded on your attendance card (see attendance section below). At the end of every class I run through all the students and award these marks, so you have a chance to improve your discussion grade each class period. I award a plus to students who make stand-out philosophical contributions to the class discussion during that period, and a check to students who participate at least once in a meaningful way. I rarely record minuses, but these are reserved for positively disruptive behavior. Four times evenly spaced through the semester I will enter a numerical discussion grade in Discovery. You are always welcome to see your card or talk to me so that you may know how well you are doing.

The next portion of your grade will come from regular (short) reading quizzes. These will be completed on Discovery and will typically consist of a few multiple-choice questions on the reading for the day. These quizzes are due before class on the day when the corresponding reading assignment is due. There is a time limit on these quizzes and they can only be taken once, so it is advisable that you complete them just as soon as you complete your reading. You will not have enough time to search the reading for the answers, but you may keep the reading assignment open to aid in the completion of the quiz. You will quickly find that you really must do the reading and do it quite carefully to do well on these quizzes.

At the end of the semester, you will submit a short (1500--2000 words) paper on Discovery reflecting on any topic we have covered in class. I will provide further guidance on this paper as the due date approaches. The midterm and the final will both comprise 15% of your grade and will mainly consist of factually oriented multiple choice questions concerning the reading (hint: it is a good idea to review past reading quizzes), but there will also be a handful of reflective short-answer questions.

## Attendance ##

Although attendance does not compose its own segment of the grade, it is mandatory and failure to attend class will adversely impact your grade. Role will be taken at the beginning of every class period. Perfect attendance will result in an extra credit of +2 percentage points. The first 2 unexcused absences will not count against you, but beginning with the 3rd absence, each absence will subtract 2 percentage points from your final grade. This goes to a **limit of 7 unexcused absences** at which point you can no longer pass the class. For your reference:

+--------------------+----------------------------------+
| Number of Absences | Percentage Change to Final Grade |
+--------------------+----------------------------------+
| 0                  | $+2$                             |
+--------------------+----------------------------------+
| 1                  | 0                                |
+--------------------+----------------------------------+
| 2                  | 0                                |
+--------------------+----------------------------------+
| 3                  | $-2$                             |
+--------------------+----------------------------------+
| 4                  | $-4$                             |
+--------------------+----------------------------------+
| 5                  | $-6$                             |
+--------------------+----------------------------------+
| 6                  | $-8$                             |
+--------------------+----------------------------------+
| 7                  | $-50$                            |

Tardiness, especially if egregious or repeated, may be counted as an absence for the day.

I keep track of absences by calling roll at the beginning of each class using a stack of index cards. You are always welcome to look at your card and I encourage you to do so because it is your responsibility to keep track of how many absences I have recorded. This is especially important for students who are in danger of failing the class because of absences. I probably will not notice when you have six absences so I am unlikely to notify you when you are in danger of failing. Students missing class or an exam due to an excused absence bear the responsibility of informing me about their absence within one week following the period of the absence (except where prior notification is required) and providing appropriate documentation for the absence. Excused absences are not taken into account in the above adjustment to the final grade. It is entirely the student's responsibility to make up missed work. Make up work (including exams) must be submitted within one week of return to class. If you miss an exam due to an unexcused absence, you will receive a grade of zero for that exam. In general, I do not excuse on-line assignments.


## E-mail ##

You are expected to have an active e-mail account that you check regularly. Section related announcements will be made via e-mail (e.g. if I am sick, pointers for home work, change in due dates). Also, e-mail is the best way for contacting me outside of class.


## Respectful Behavior ##

Mature, respectful behavior is expected in class. The primary concern is that all students are able to enjoy a focused, helpful classroom. This means that I expect you will among other things: arrive to class on time, stay awake, refrain from taking cell phone calls, playing games, or doing work for other classes. I will warn you once during a semester if a particular behavior is disruptive. If this behavior happens again, I may ask you to leave resulting in an absence for the day.

Class time is primarily focused on discussion of the material for which I expect you to be fully engaged. For this reason, I prohibit the use of electronic devices in class.


## Academic Integrity ##

Cheating robs other students of a fair grade. If it is determined that a student has cheated, all students involved will receive a grade of zero for the assignment. If the case is egregious, I will direct the case to the appropriate university dean for official sanction.
