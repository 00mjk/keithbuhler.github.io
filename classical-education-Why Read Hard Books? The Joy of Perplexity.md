# Why Read Hard Books? The Joy of Perplexity

Reading Hegel 2013 — totally bewildered

Reading Aristotle in 2000 — 10 pages per hour

Anecdote: JP is one of the smartest guys I know; and he always reads one book over his head. 

Anecdote: $10,000 admission to hear this business leader speak. What did he say? Bad managers avoid conflict. Good managers manage conflict. Great managers facilitate conflict. 

A pragmatic consideration: Investment, leverage. It always takes some money to make some money. It takes some time to clear up your schedule. It takes some hard work to make your life easier. It takes some hard thinking to make the truth plain. 

Anecdote: 

It’s not about getting the answers. Or, it is about getting the answers, but it’s also about becoming a certain kind of person. 

Quote: T.S. Eliot, East Coker: You say I am repeating / Something I have said before. I shall say it again. / Shall I say it again? In order to arrive there, / To arrive where you are, to get from where you are not,/ You must go by a way wherein there is no ecstacy. / In order to arrive at what you do not know / You must go by a way which is the way of ignorance. / In order to possess what you do not possess / You must go by the way of dispossession. / In order to arrive at what you are not / You must go through the way in which you are not. / And what you do not know is the only thing you know / And what you own is what you do not own / And where you are is where you are not.

Quote: Heracleitus, “The way up is the way down.” 

Four Levels

One: Physical

Two: Allegorical 1:  Allegorical proper: Christ’s going down into sheol to raise us up to heaven. “He descended into hell.” “He became sin for us”

Three: Allegorical 2: Moral: The soul humiliating itself to be exalted. “Humble yourself.”

Four: Allegorical 3: Anagogical/Mystical: The death of the self resulting in unification with Christ. “Our life is hid with Christ.” 

Quote: “You cannot solve a problem with the same level of consciousness that created it.” Anon (not Einstein nor Jung)

Quote: Here and there it happened in my practice that a patient grew beyond himself because of unknown potentialities, and this became an experience of prime importance to me. I had learned in the meanwhile that the greatest and most important problems of life are all in a certain sense insoluble. They must be so because they express the necessary polarity inherent in every self-regulating system. They can never be solved, but only outgrown. The Secret of the Golden Flower (1931) Commentary by C.G.Jung in CW 13: Alchemical Studies. P. 60. 

Quote: Bill Vallilicenna, expresses the way not to argue, “this is the way ideologues operate. Never criticize your own, your fellow naturalists in this case. Never concede anything to your opponents. Never hesitate, admit doubt or puzzlement. Keep your eyes on the prize. Winning alone is what counts. Never follow an argument where it leads if it leads away from the party line.”

Anology/Parable: The Kingdom of Wisdom is like a warm and secure house on the bluff of a stormy coast. Imagine you wake up on a beach along the Atlantic ocean.  You are trapped in a bay by a cliffside bluff, and the tide is coming in. It is a stormy coast, a rough and treacherous terrain, and you are cold, and it’s getting darker.  You are on the sand and you want to get to the top of the bluff where there appears (through the mist) a home, with a fire, and food. You begin by trying to move across the beach to get just under the house before you start climbing, but ocean waves knock you over, and scrape you on the rocks. So you retreat and start going up first. You walk, scramble, and climb on the slippery rocks, moving up and laterally. Unfortunately, once under the house (and over the sea), you slip, and fall twenty feet down. Thanks to a few feet of water just ebbing out, and soft sand, you land without injury. Before the next wave crashes, you run back to where you started, dry off, and begin climbing again. This time you go laterally first, over the water rather than the sand, since now you know it’s better to fall with a splash than with a thud. Then you climb up, and up, and up. Finally, you reach a point of the bluff that is angled enough to allow scrambling up. You reach the house, exhausted, wet, scrapped, and starved. The nice people let you in and all is well. The house is the true answer to some question. The sea is the ocean of ignorance, the apeiron. The climb is the dialectic.  Falling is perplexity, realizing that you do not know. The rocks and steps are received opinions of common men and wise men. The scrapes and bruises are doubts, frustrations, despondency. The rising tide is time, which will extinguish all our ratiocination eventually, whether we have reached the truth or no. 

Quote: Pascal, Pensees, I.9 “When we wish to correct with advantage and to show another that he errs, we must notice from what side he views the matter, for on that side it is usually true, and admit that truth to him, but reveal to him the side on which it is false. He is satisfied with that, for he sees that he was not mistaken and that he only failed to see all sides. Now, no one is offended at not seeing everything; but one does not like to be mistaken, and that perhaps arises from the fact that man naturally cannot see everything, and that naturally he cannot err in the side he looks at, since the perceptions of our senses are always true.”

10. People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered than by those which have come into the mind of others.
