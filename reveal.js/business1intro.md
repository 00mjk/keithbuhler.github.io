## What is this class about? 

Some of the hardest decisions we make have to do with business. 
As employees, professionals, managers, investors, or entrepreneurs, we will make tough business decisions every day. Even as consumers we will "vote with our dollars" when we buy product, use, re-use, and recycle. This course attempts to help us to think deeply about the issues of wealth, fairness, politics, trade, payment, and work. The aim is that we can act well when hard decisions come.

## Philosophy

Philosophy in generally asks questions about foundations of the world and our knowledge of it: what is real, how do we know what we know, what is the meaning of life? Philosophy is continuous with science, mathematics, religion. So when we conduct business, our whole world view is engaged.

## Philosophy -> Ethics

Ethics is the branch of philosophy that investigates right and wrong, good and bad. What is worthwhile or worthless and how to live a worthwhile life. What is good? Who is truly enviable?

## Ethics—> Business Ethics

In business ethics, we ask about foundations: 

* What is a good business? 
* What is good for a business? What is success? 
* What is property — public and private?
* What products or services should business not provide?
* Is money worthwhile? What does it outweigh?

## Philosophy—> Business Ethics


These questions and more we will attempt to answer by clarifying terms, establishing secure ethical principles, being sensitive to contextual details, identifying reasonable answers, evaluating arguments for and against each reasonable answer, and coming to our own conclusions.

Though we will consider arguments from Kantian, consequentialist, and religious standpoints, our official approach to these questions will be from the standpoint of traditional virtue ethics.

## Ethics applied to business. 

* Most basically, business ethics is ethics applied to business. 
* *Either* philosophers who think deeply about these issues.  
* *or* businessmen who care about creating an ethical culture, conducting their trade ethically, and being socially responsible.

Business ethics is done by those with a philosophy background or those with a business background. I am an entrepreneur as well, but we are approaching it from philosophy and ethics.

## Unethical business

Businesses and businessmen (gender neutral) can go do bad on purpose or on accident. (Compare "sins of commission" and "sins of ommission.")

Companies can be bad to their employees, bad to their customers, bad to other companies, bad to the government, or bad to the world at large.

## Philosophical methods

How does a philosopher do his or her job? 

* We progress by conversation and philosophical dialogue. 
* We have to stand back from our personal knee-jerk viewpoint or cultural viewpoints. What if something deep about our collective way of viewing things is wrong? How would we correct it? Only by stepping back and considering views wide afield. 
* Asking questions, and following the argument.
