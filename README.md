Thanks for visiting. I hope you find the site informative and easy on the eyes. [Send us an email](emailto:info@keithbuhler.com) if you spot any typos or dead links.

### Map

The main site consists of five pages: HOME, ABOUT, RESEARCH, TEACHING, and the PHILOSOPHY PORTAL for students. 

HOME and ABOUT are self-explanatory. RESEARCH offers a link to my CV, dissertation, and a brief research statement. TEACHING offers links to syllabi, a brief teaching statement, and some reviews from students and employers. The PHILOSOPHY PORTAL invites students to learn the benefits of studying philosophy and coaches them on how to succeed. 


### Design

Design-wise, I started with Dan Sheffler's site and made changes inspired by [Baron Peter Von Elswyk](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~pdv12/research.html) and [Andrew M. Bailey](http://www.andrewmbailey.com/). After learning a lot about CSS by building from the ground up, I started over with the very powerful and beautiful [Minimal Mistakes Layout](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) from New York designer Michael Rose, and have made slight changes from there.

To make your own similar website would take some work, especially if you have zero programming experience. But you can do it. Start [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Or you could [hire me to make one for you.](/sites)

### History

This site is my *eighth* draft. The [2013 first try](https://web.archive.org/web/20130511005256/http://keithbuhler.com) used GoDaddy's automatic one page builder and it was terrible. The [2015 second try](https://web.archive.org/web/20141217142037/http://keithbuhler.com/) with Web Zyro's automatic builder was also not great. Ultimately, I wanted more control over content and style, so I kept searching. 

[Dan Sheffler](http://www.dansheffler.com) showed me his site and got me started using Markdown. There was a learning curve, but I am tech curious and enjoyed the problem-solving. Over Christmas 2015, I worked compulsively on making the content and organization the data.  Versions 3-6 were failed attempts at using Github (first username was circularreason.github.io). Version 7 worked. Now it's a work in progress. 

### Source Code

I start by writing posts and pages in plain text with simple [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) mark up. 

A wonderful software called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) transforms the plain text files into HTML. The source HTML is *stored* on my hard-drive, but it's *hosted* for free by [Github](http://www.github.com).
