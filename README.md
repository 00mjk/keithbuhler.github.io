Thanks for visiting. I hope you find the site fun, easy on the eyes, and informative. 

[Let me know](emailto:info@keithbuhler.com) if you spot any typos or dead links.) 

Everything was created by Keith Buhler using a simple programming language called [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Plain text Markdown files are converted to HTML by an amazing software called [Jekyll.](https://jekyllrb.com/) While the source HTML is *stored* on my hard-drive, it's *hosted* for free by an open-source community called [Github](http://www.github.com).

### Code

This represents my *eighth* try to create a website.  My [first site](https://web.archive.org/web/20130511005256/http://keithbuhler.com) in 2013 used GoDaddy's automatic one page builder. It was terrible. My [second site](https://web.archive.org/web/20141217142037/http://keithbuhler.com/) used Web Zyro's automatic builder. Also not great. Ultimately, I wanted more control over content and style, so I kept searching. 

[Dan Sheffler](http://www.dansheffler.com) showed me his site and got me started using Markdown. There was a learning curve, but I am tech curious and enjoyed the problem-solving. Over Christmas 2015, I worked compulsively on making the content and organization the data.  Versions 3-6 were failed attempts at using Github (first username was circularreason.github.io). Version 7 worked. Now it's a work in progress. 

Design-wise, I started with Dan Sheffler's site and made changes inspired by [Baron Peter Von Elswyk](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~pdv12/research.html) and [Andrew M. Bailey](http://www.andrewmbailey.com/). After learning a lot about CSS by building from the ground up, I started over with the very powerful and beautiful [Minimal Mistakes Layout](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) from New York designer Michael Rose, and have made slight changes from there.

To make your own similar website, if you have zero programming knowledge, will take some work. But you can do it. Start [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
