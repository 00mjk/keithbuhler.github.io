## Site

Thanks for visiting. I hope you find the site fun, easy on the eyes, and informative. 
Everything was created by Keith Buhler using a simple programming language called [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown).

## Code

This is my *eigth* try to create my personal website.  My [first site](https://web.archive.org/web/20130511005256/http://keithbuhler.com) in 2013 used GoDaddy's automatic one page builder. It was terrible. My [second site](https://web.archive.org/web/20141217142037/http://keithbuhler.com/) used Web Zyro's automatic builder. Also not great. Ultimately I like more control over content and style. 

Philosopher and programming Sith Lord [Dan Sheffler](http://www.dansheffler.com) gave me the idea, the instructions, and (in some instances) the code to get started creating my own site using Markdown.

The Markdown text files are converted automatically to HTML by an amazing software called [Jekyll.](https://jekyllrb.com/) That HTML is stored on my harddrive and also synced to open source programming community called [Github,](http://www.github.com) which hosts websites for free. 

Over Christmas 2015 I worked compulsively on making the content and organization the data.  Versions 3-6 were failed attempts at using Github (circularreason.github.io). Version 7 worked. Now it's a work in progress. Design-wise, I started with Dan Sheffler's site and made changes inspired by [Baron Peter Von Elswyk](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~pdv12/research.html) and [Andrew M. Bailey](http://www.andrewmbailey.com/). After learning a lot about CSS, I caved in and forked the [Minimal Mistakes Layout](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) from designer Michael Rose.

To make your own similar website, if you have zero programming knowledge, will take some work. But you can do it. Start [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
