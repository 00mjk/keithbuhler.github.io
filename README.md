This site is built more or less from scratch in plain text. Jekyll transforms the Markdown-styled text into HTML and Github hosts it for me. You can view and even duplicate the source code [here](http://bit.ly/2lYmQsa).

Below, I explain in more detail about the site.

### Style


Keith Buhler created the content and style with help from [Dan Sheffler](http://www.dansheffler.com/), Jekyll, Michael Rose, [W3Schools](www.w3schools.com) and the good folks at [Github](https://github.com). 

![github cat](https://technologyconversations.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/github.png?w=625)

The CSS design consists of modified version of the beautiful [Minimal Mistakes Layout](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) by New York designer [Michael Rose.](https://mademistakes.com/) 

The content is written in plain text [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and stored on my hard-drive. 

When it's ready to publish, an amazing software called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) transforms the plain text files into HTML which is  *hosted* and published for free by Github. Amazing, right?


### Map

The main site consists of HOME (with links to my dissertation, a brief research statement, links to syllabi, a brief teaching statement, and some reviews from students and employers), CV (my academic resume), PAPERS (a summary of publications forthcoming), and the STUDENT PORTAL (a separate site with resources for my students). 


### History

This site is my *eighth* draft. The [2013 first try](https://web.archive.org/web/20130511005256/http://keithbuhler.com) used GoDaddy's automatic one page builder and it was terrible. The [2015 second try](https://web.archive.org/web/20141217142037/http://keithbuhler.com/) with Web Zyro's automatic builder was also not great. Ultimately, I wanted more control over content and style, so I kept searching. 

[Dan Sheffler](http://www.dansheffler.com) showed me his site and got me started using Markdown. There was a learning curve, but I am tech curious and enjoyed the problem-solving. Over Christmas 2015, I worked compulsively on making the content and organization the data.  Versions 3-6 were failed attempts at using Github (first username was circularreason.github.io). Version 7 worked. Now it's a work in progress. 

Design-wise, I started with Dan Sheffler's site and made changes inspired by [Baron Peter Von Elswyk](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~pdv12/research.html) and [Andrew M. Bailey](http://www.andrewmbailey.com/). After learning a lot about CSS by building from the ground up, I started over with the very powerful and beautiful [Minimal Mistakes Layout](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) from New York designer Michael Rose, and have made slight changes from there.

### DIY

If you know programming, you can make your own similar website easily, over which you have total control. If you have zero programming experience, but you are tech-curious, you can do it. It will take some work. Start [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). (Alternately, I could [make yours for you.](/sites))
