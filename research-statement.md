## Example
Now that I have successfully defended my qualitative dissertation on video journalism, I
am starting the next phase of my research, specifically, quantitative experimental studies
of video journalism as a new media form. Thus far I’ve found that video journalism is
seen by its practitioners and institutional adopters as a news form that is distinct from
conventional television. Beyond its obvious differences in the production & delivery
process (singular versus collaborative shooting, broadband versus broadcast), video
journalism may have narrative differences that are significant in their service to the
public sphere. It’s impossible to know without further inquiry.
I’ve already designed a set of quasi-experiments that can be conducted on-line. The
protocol received approval from the University of Pennsylvania’s Institutional Review
Board. Alas, it proved “too much” to include in my dissertation, which is a qualitative
study of the practice of video journalism in a variety of institutions, such as the Voice of
America, the BBC, commercial television stations and newspapers. No overview of this
new media form exists; it became essential to write a careful analysis of the form itself
before embarking on audience reception studies. I have applied for a small grant from my
current department at the Kutztown University of Pennsylvania to start this work.
Briefly, my experiments are designed to measure the degree to which viewers of news
images and video detect and process the presence of a photographer. What are the effects
when narratives shift from third-person to first-person accounts? What are the effects of
symbols or markers that denote the institutional source of an image? Are video stories
more understandable and credible when we see and hear from the person who shot the
video?
My wish list for institutional support of my research agenda includes 1) a department that
supports both qualitative and quantitative methods, 2) an institutional review board that
operates in a timely and responsive manner, 3) computer equipment that allows for the
delivery of quasi-experimental materials on-line and 4) departmental support for grantseeking
activities.
Finally, I am an active member of two academic organizations, the Association for
Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC) and the International
Communication Association (ICA) and hope to continue my involvement in those
organizations, which o
