## An imaginary dialogue

Trump: we should protect our country by enforcing its laws.

You: Trump is outrageous he's a racist he's a Nazi.

Me: I don't agree with Trump but I like that he says his mind.

You: How could you say that? Everything he says offends me. And it set half the country on a righteous tirade.

Me: That's exactly what I like.

You: Wow, your political views betray your evil character.

Me: Now you're beginning to understand how I feel about you.
