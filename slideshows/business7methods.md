7. Philosophical theories have been used in ethical training, but the integration is lumpy (26)
8. Integrating philosophical theory into business ethics remains one of its most persisent challenges of the field.
9. Normative ethics has "primacy of place", but there is some metaethics.
10. Shortcomings include the fact that "case study" has replaced high level theory. (28)

## Empirical Methods

1. Work in economics, political science, psychology and social psychology, ethnography, anthropology, sociology. 
2. Game theory, study of ethical conduct, and misconduct, such as lying, cheating, stealing, whistle-blowing, bribery, environmental abuse, and so one. 
3. Primatology Frans de Waal undermines the assumption that human beings are "driven by selfishness" (29)
4. Integrated Social Contract Theory of Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee "seeks to address... the abstraction and generality of many ethical theories and their seeming irrelevance to the concrete norms, values, and practices with which business managers must work." (29)

5. ISCT integrates macrosocial contracts that take presedence, religious, philosophical, social beliefs, with microsocial agreements, in communities, regions, businesses, etvs. 
6. There is tension between normative and descriptive methods. (31) normatively inclined business ethicist Candy is a language that involves critical rational analysis of arguments. They also presume the autonomy and moral agency of those working in business environments. In contrast, empirical research or is use the language of description and empirical methods to measure, explain, and predict behavior in organizations. Their scientific orientation leads them to hold a more deterministic view of human nature." (31)

## Focus on Individual Decision Making

1. Most methods focus on the manager. 
2. Business ethics emerged in contrast to the "amoral" pragmatic view of management.
3. Why focus on the individual manager? Partly because that is how business ethics courses were focused. It has also tried to show the "link between ethics and corporate flourishing" (33) Doing good leads to doing well. This still puts the definition of success as profit. 
4. The Stakeholder theory shows how the Corporate Social Responsibility has other aims besides profit.

4. A second effect of focusing on individual managers is understanding how individual decisions exist within a system that supports or doesn't lead to ethical conduct. (33). 
5. John Boatright argued that the Moral Manager Model "rests on the assumption that the business organization is the fudamental unit of analysis for business ethics" when it should be "the market itself", a system of businesses, economic systems such as capitalism, and even the laws.
