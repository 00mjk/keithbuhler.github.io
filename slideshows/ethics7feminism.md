### Preface

- Take the good wherever it is found
- If you are a feminist, "feminist ethics" is not a monolith, but a cluster of truth claims you must judge case by case
- If you are not a feminist, "feminist ethics" makes truth claims you can judge case by case
- Some of what is labeled "feminist" may be true and some may be false
- In other words, labels are not everything!

- Downplay moral principles and traditional ethical concepts

### Fundamental paradox

- Women are the same as men, so differences should be refuted.
- Women are different from men in some ways, and those differences should be valued. 
- Compare: not only intrinsic moral value, but intellectual ability, emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, technical ability, homemaking, being soldiers, thinking, reasoning, etc. 
- "Masculine or male associated values": independence, autonomy, intellect, will, wariness, hierarchy, etc,
- "Feminine or female-associated values": interdependence, community, connection, sharing, emotion, body, trust, absence of hiarachy, etc.
