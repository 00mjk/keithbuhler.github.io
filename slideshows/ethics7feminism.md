### Preface

- Take the good wherever it is found
- If you are a feminist, "feminist ethics" is not a monolith, but a cluster of truth claims you must judge case by case
- If you are not a feminist, "feminist ethics" makes truth claims you can judge case by case
- Some of what is labeled "feminist" may be true and some may be false
- In other words, labels are not everything!

### Feminist Ethics Overview

- Downplay moral principles and traditional ethical concepts
- Focus on social and relational realities
- Familiar principles: autonomy, utility, freedom, equality, etc. are too broad and abstract
- Values and virtues in traditional moral theories skew masculine 
- Concept of autonomous agent is falsely abstract

### Fundamental paradox

- Women are the same as men, so differences should be refuted.
- Women are different from men in some ways, and those differences should be valued. 
- Compare: not only intrinsic moral value, but intellectual ability, emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, technical ability, homemaking, being soldiers, thinking, reasoning, etc. 
- "Masculine or male associated values": independence, autonomy, intellect, will, wariness, hierarchy, etc,
- "Feminine or female-associated values": interdependence, community, connection, sharing, emotion, body, trust, absence of hiarachy, etc.

## The Need for More Than Justice

- Rawls: Justice is the first virtue of social institutions 
- The counter-Rawls movement argues that "justice is one virtue among many" (466)
- Can "care" supplement -- not replace -- justice?
- Is care female? Feminine? Not the prerogative of women (466)

</section><section data-markdown>

### Maternity

- Caring is a virtue of caretakers, esp. motherhood
- Why mothers?
- Children depend on parents to avoid isolation and powerlessness


> Some find it retrograde to hail as a special sort of moral wisdom an outlook that may be the product of socially enforced restriction of women to domestic roles...


</section><section data-markdown>

### Maternity

- Women, like blacks, use the language of "rights" to change their social position
- Yet find that Kantian notions of "rights" do not satisfy all moral dimensions


</section><section data-markdown>

### Kohlburg

- Kohlberg followed Kant and Piaget
- Kohlberg's experiments: testing pre-conventional, conventional, post-conventional moral thinking
- Found that women were more likely to score "lower" on Kohlberg's test
- The assumption is that impartial, impersonal, "legal" thinking is morally mature
- Gilligan challenged this



</section><section data-markdown>

### Individual Rights and Equality

- Misery is compatible with rights (469)
- Equality creates social "fractures" (470)
- Mature men and women wanted interconnection, family, friends, society rather than autonomy and being left alone
- Communitarian moral ideals are closer to "religion-linked" versions of morality than the "modern Western liberal ideal"
- Also closer to Hegel
