# Abortion




</section> <!--Intro slide end-->
<section data-markdown>  <!--Slide Beginning-->



### Three Views

1. Never permissible because the unborn is human
2. Always permissible because the mother is autonomous
3. Sometimes permissible, sometimes impermissible


</section><section data-markdown>

### Thesis

Although secular thinkers believe opposition to abortion is a symptom of religion, abortion is in almost every case seriously immoral because killing a human fetus deprives it of its future. 

</section><section data-markdown>


### Arguments

1. Anti-life & anti-abortion positions are symmetrical: both appear plausible, appear "obvious", rest on basic truths such as the right to life and the right to bodily autonomy. 
2. Fetus is not non-human... it is human (not a possum), so is it a human being, a human person, human cells? 
3. If it's acceptable to kill human fetuses because they lack consciousness, rationality, will, decisions, etc., then it is acceptable to kill the elderly, disabled, or comatose who lack those traits.
4. If it's unacceptable to kill human fetuses, then it is unacceptable for mothers to determine their sexual choices, what happens in their own bodies and in their wombs.

### Arguments
5. It is wrong to kill _us_ because killing deprives us of our future: experiences, projects, activities, etc.
6. This principle explains why might be wrong to kill non-human animals too
7. It explains why it might be acceptable to euthanize the elderly who do not have much future 
8. It explains why it is especially unacceptable to kill infants and young children
9. A fetus has a "future [with] a standard set of experiences, projects, activities and such which are identical with the futures of adult human beings... and young children."

### Arguments

1. "Since it is wrong to kill persons, it is wrong to kill potential persons also."
2. Compare to the argument against torturing animals: what's wrong with inflicting wanton pain? Simply that it causes suffering. 
3. What makes it wrong to hurt humans is that it causes suffering, and so likewise what makes it wrong to hurt animals is that it causes suffering.

### Objections

1. Maybe abortion is only prima facie wrong, not wrong in all circumstances. Response: yes, just as killing another is only acceptable in very rare circumstances (war, self-defense, death penalty)
2. Maybe it's just wrong to discontinue the life of someone who already enjoys life or who has strong desires. Response: it's still wrong to kill people who don't have strong desires, or the unconscious, or suicidal.

### My opinion: Five justifications

1. Sexual liberation -- Any sexual activity that leads to pregnancy is justified, but pregnancy may not be desirable, so abortion is permissible to protect reproductive sexuality activity. 
2. "Clump of cells" -- Fetus are not human beings/human persons
3. Bodily Autonomy -- Whatever is done to a woman's womb is not subject to legal or social oversight. 
4. Emotional Trauma -- a baby conceived in rape or incest would cause intolerable ongoing trauma to the mother
4. Bodily Safety -- killing the fetus to save the mother's life


</section><section data-markdown>

### Three responses

1. Sexual liberation -- some sexual practices are immoral; others are moral but the consequences cannot be avoided. 
2. "Clump of cells" -- a fetus is a human being
3. Bodily Autonomy -- it is wrong to drink or do drugs while pregnant. So bodily autonomy is compatible with oversight.
4. Emotional trauma -- the child conceived can and [often is  a good that redeems the trauma](https://www.thoughtco.com/with-love-all-things-are-possible-3534137), rather continues it.
5. Bodily safety -- it is permissible sometimes to kill an innocent human being to save another innocent human being; but this is true of any case including abortion.
