# Basics of the Stock Market

1. **Communal ownership.** All shareholders own tiny percentages ("shares") of a company. You can buy one part of Google for $800, one part of Facebook for $127, Twitter for $22. Uber is not publicly traded. Google has 2 billion shares, so you're buying one billionth of the company for $800. 
2. **Communal wealth.** If Google masters the self-driving car and makes a trillion dollars on it, their stock value goes up. Your $800 share might be worth $1,600 overnight. (If you own 100 shares, you could make $800,000 overnight.)
3. **Communal risk.** If Twitter's new policies drive away users and scare investors, and their stock value goes down, your $22 share might be worth $11 overnight.

# Basics of the Stock Market (cont'd)

4. **Hierarchical Ownership.** Some shares are owned by the board, the CEO, and the employees, and the rest are owned by the public investors. For example, Mark Zuckerberg's wealth is largely in shares of FB, not cash. Same for Bill Gates. Zuckerberg owns 28% of FB, which is worth about $24 billion. Jeff Rothschild owns 0.8% of FB, which is worth $680 million.
5. **Trading.** Individual investors and investment firms "buy low and sell high." They try to make educated guesses about the future value of a company. If they think it is likely to go up, they buy low and wait it out, then sell high. If they think it is likely to go down, they sell high before the drop. 
6. **Secondary Markets**. You can buy stocks or "stock options." Stock options are not actual shares. Stock options are like coupons that you can buy future shares at today's price. Stock options are cheaper than actual stocks, so you can buy more of them. You can easily lose money.

# Key Terms

1. Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO): a single bundle of debts you can invest in. 
2. Credit Default Swaps (CDS):
3. Regulation: government or non-government rules intended to keep the stock market secure, stable, legal, and to protect investors. 
4. Ratings Agencies: Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch. They "rate a debtor's ability to pay back debt." Will the debtor default (miss payments)?
