## Church Fathers or "Apostolic Fathers"
- Mentored by the Apostles, but not Apostles
- Many writers, leaders, preachers, thinkers of the church from the Apostles to about the 8th century
- Justin Martyr is in this broad group
- One of the first "apologists"

### Apologetics: The General Question

- How do you share the gospel with those who do not know Jesus but _do_ love truth and goodness?
- How do you connect the known with the unknown? 

</section><section data-markdown>

### Apologetics: Two Answers

- Peter's Pentecost sermon (to Jews) -- appeal to OT Scripture
- Paul's Mars Hill sermon (to Greeks) -- appeal to Reason

### Let's look at Justin's approach... 

</section><section data-markdown>

>To the Emperor Titus... Pius Augustus Cæsar, and to his son Verissimus the Philosopher... and to the sacred Senate, with the whole People of the Romans, I, Justin, the son of Priscus and grandson of Bacchius... present this address and petition in behalf of those of all nations who are unjustly hated and wantonly abused, myself being one of them.

- What do you notice here?
- What rhetorical devices?

### There's lots in Justin's _Apology_
### Let's look at three more passages

</section><section data-markdown>

>Reason directs those who are **truly pious and philosophical to honour and love only what is true**, declining to follow traditional opinions, if these be worthless... Do you, then, since you are called pious and philosophers, guardians of justice and lovers of learning, give good heed, and hearken to my address; and **if you are indeed such, it will be manifested.**

- Common love of truth

## Socrates I

>And when Socrates endeavoured, by true reason and examination, to bring these things to light, and deliver men from the demons, [these demons and sinners] put him to death as an atheist and a profane person, on the charge that he was introducing new divinities; and in our case they display a similar activity. 

- Socrates and Christians were both charged with "atheism" for rejecting the false pagan gods


</section><section data-markdown>

## Socrates II

>For not only among the Greeks did _Logos_ prevail to condemn these things through Socrates, but also among the Barbarians were they condemned by _Logos_ Himself, who took shape, and became man, and was called Jesus Christ

- Logos in common


</section><section data-markdown>

## Conclusion

>And if these things seem to you to be reasonable and true, honour them; but if they seem nonsensical, despise them as nonsense, and do not decree death against those who have done no wrong, as you would against enemies. For we forewarn you, that you shall not escape the coming judgment of God, if you continue in your injustice; and we ourselves will invite you to do that which is pleasing to God.

- Rejecting non-sense in common

<section data-markdown><!--Discussion of faith and reason begin-->
 

## Discussion Question

- Today, what is something Christians have in common with non-Christians leaders/examples? 
- How can we build on that to preach the gospel to secular folks?
