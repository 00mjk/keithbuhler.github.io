# Philosophy of CS Lewis

### Truth and Longing


</section><!--end slide--> <section data-markdown>

## Kreeft's basic thesis? 

_Truth is real._

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Three senses of "Truth"

|Name            |  Sense         |    Example       |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Substantive Truth | Reality itself |          Mount Everest being a mountain. |
| Knowledge       |  Thinking truly  |         *Mount Everest is a mountain.* |
| True words      |  Speaking truly  |         “Mount Everest is a mountain.” |




</section> <section data-markdown>

>“Truth is saying of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not.” (Aristotle)

Reality —>              Thought —>        Expression in language 

Truth itself                  True thought           True statement

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Nihilism

* What is the opposite of truth? 
* The denial of truth — objective truth — is nihilism, the denial of reality itself. 
* Hence, Gorgias of Athens said: 

>Nothing exists;

> Even if something exists, nothing can be known about it; and

> Even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it can't be communicated to others.

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Nihilism

Hence, also, Nietszsche: 

>*“It is true, there could be a metaphysical world; the absolute possibility of it is hardly to be disputed. We behold all things through the human head and cannot cut off this head; while the question nonetheless remains what of the world would still be there if one had cut it off.”* 

*Human, All Too Human*, s.9, R.J. Hollingdale transl.

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Truth and Longing

- We *must* accept the truth, even if it is ugly.
- We can enjoy the beautiful, high, voluptuous, and splendid Northernness, even if it is false. 


</section><section data-background="http://mesosyn.com/myth1-Norse-Yggdrasil.jpg" data-markdown>

## What if the beautiful were true, and the truth beautiful?
