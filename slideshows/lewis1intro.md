## Grading

|Assignments                            | Percent of grade |
 -------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
  Reading & Quizzes                     | 30%
  Participation (talk, write, present)  | 30%
  Unit Papers                           | 40%

I do not normally round. So an 89.5 is a “B.”

## Attendance

I give everyone up to 3 "Personal absences". These 3 absences apply for *for any reason*, including emergencies, family visits, sickness, sports, or sleep. One week is usually sufficient for emergencies, and sometimes you just need a break. But after that, absences *require an excuse*. After 3 personal absences, any unexcused absences will cost 2% deduction from the semester grade *per absence*. 6 unexcused absences is a letter grade and 9 will make a passing grade impossible.

### Attendance
We need you here! Attendance is mandatory. Roll will be taken each class by marking a 3x5 card.  (Being repeatedly or egregiously late will count as an absence.) You may check your absences at any time by requesting to see your card. I recommend you aim for perfect attendance to maximize your learning. You are paying for this education including this class, so why wouldn’t you make the most of it?  

</section><section data-markdown>

### Reading tips

* Read ahead. Read carefully. 
* You will get faster, but start slow and careful. 
* Try to read *and understand* the book. What is the main thesis? Is it true?  
* Take notes. Talk with each other before class. 
* More are tips [available online.](http://www.keithbuhler.com/philosophy-class)



</section><section data-markdown>
### Quizzes
Short reading quizzes assess that you read the day's text. These are easy points. Also, read to *understand*. Come to class with thoughts, questions. Ask yourself: What is the main point? What confused me?

### Attendance cont'd

* That said, I give everyone up to 3 "Personal absences". 
* These 3 absences apply for *for any reason*, including emergencies, family visits, sickness, sports, or sleep.
*  3 absences adds up to one week of classes you can miss with no penalty. 3 is usually sufficient for emergencies, and sometimes you just need a break. But after that, absences *require an excuse*. 
*  After 3 personal absences, any unexcused absences will cost 2% deduction from the semester grade *per absence*. 
*  6 unexcused absences is a letter grade and 9 will make a passing grade impossible.

### Participation


The primary competency of this class is philosophical dialogue. 

Hence, you must attend and participate. Class time is primarily focused on discussion of the material for which I expect you to be fully engaged.

</section><section data-markdown>

We do dialogue for five main reasons: 

1. You must take responsibility for your own learning. 
2. We can actually get to know each other.  
3. I learn best in discussion. 
4. Most people learn (and retain) best in discussion. 
5. Philosophy is dialogical. 

</section><section data-markdown>
### Participation

* *You are responsible to talk in class.* 
* Even if you are confused, tired, or unmotivated, I expect you to make yourself participate and engage. 
* Get out of your comfort zone into your growth zone. 
* Come *prepared*. Read, take notes, reflect, and come ready to share your viewpoint, defend it, listen to others' viewpoints, and critique theirs.  

</section><section data-markdown>
### Participation
Everyone starts at an 80% (B-) for the participation grade. You will move up or down depending on whether you pay attention and speak at least once per week. (I prohibit the use of electronic devices in class, although laptop users may request permission to sit in the front of class with their computers.) Other [discussion ground rules are posted online.](http://www.keithbuhler.com/discussion101)

</section><section data-markdown>
### Participation
To earn participation points, you will voluntarily share your thoughts in discussion at least once per week, and/or respond when called upon. You are not required to write posts on the discussion board online. By default, everyone is an "external processor".  *"Internal processors"*: Some may wish to opt out of speaking in class and emphasize writing.  To earn participation points, you will post class reflections online every week. You may elect to speak in class as well, and may be called upon.

### Critical Reading:
Every student will present two group "critical readings." Your group of 2-3 people must meet ahead of time to read and discuss the assignment more thoroughly than your normal reading. You will then summarize the reading, analyze it, and present your own opinions. One or all of you will present your summary to the class. Instructions are posted online. 

</section><section data-markdown>
### Test
There are Quarter 1 and Quarter 3 exams. The exams might draw questions from quizzes, so pay attention to questions you may have missed. A study guide may be provided. New questions (on familiar material) may be introduced, or a new phrasing of questions  you have seen before.

</section><section data-markdown>
### Unit Papers
Every student will write several Unit Papers. These Unit Papers help you synthesize your own views after doing the readings and listening to lectures and participating in the discussions. This assignment is pass/fail, so follow the instructions closely. Be careful to cite your sources correctly. I will not tolerate plagiarism — unintentional or intentional.  If I detect plagiarism, I will contact you. The assignment will receive a zero, and disciplinary action may follow. The instructions are posted online.
