### 2. Private Property

Communism is the "positive abolition of private property" -- Marx. (75)

Capitalism is private property of... what? 

Bob owns some property P. 

* Consumer goods (goods you use, like food, clothes, wifi)
* Capital goods (goods required for producing other goods, i.e., farm equipment)
* "Maximally extensive feasible property rights:" Bob gets to use, exclude others from use, manage, to compensation if damaged, waste, use for money, free of government coercion, indefinitely, and to sell or rent. (75-6)

### The Tragedy of commons

>“Nor can certain harmful effects of deforestation, or of some methods of farming, or of the smoke and noise of factories, be confined to the owner of the property in question or to those who are willing to submit to the damage for an agreed compensation.  In such instances we must find some substitute for the regulation by the price mechanism.  

>But the fact that we have to resort to the substitution of direct regulation by authority where the conditions for the proper working of competition cannot be created, does not prove that we should suppress competition where it can be made to function.”  (Hayek, 1944)

### Before you go

Is capitalism justifiable?

—Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom (1962)

“[C]apitalism works better than it sounds, while socialism sounds better than it works.“ 
—Richard M. Nixon, Beyond Peace (1994)
