## Pojman Introduction

- Ethics is systematic, rational search for answers to moral questions. 
- Ethics is not easy, but neither is it futile. 
- Example: not sure whether or not to get a job

## What makes morality different?

1. Morality is **Evaluative, not descriptive.** Example: "John was driving at reckless speeds" vs. "John was driving 100." Morality also evaluates or judges.

1. Morality is **Evaluative, not descriptive.**
2. Morality is **Overriding**. "I should drive the speed limit" versus "I ought to drive faster to get to the heart attack victim." Moral laws override civil laws.

1. Morality is **Evaluative, not descriptive.**
2. Morality is **Overriding**. 
3. Morality is **Impartial**. "I should be friends with anyone I like, and don't have to be friends with anyone I don't like." versus "I should be nice to anyone I like and be mean to anyone I don't like." You can be partial about non-moral things but morality demands impartial treatment for moral equals. Morally relevant differences are exceptions -- felons can't vote!

1. Morality is **Evaluative, not descriptive.**
2. Morality is **Overriding**. 
3. Morality is **Impartial**. 
4. Morality is **Universal**. "Drive on the left side of the road in England," versus "Be hospitable to strangers in England." Non-moral norms are relative to time, place, culture, etc. But moral norms are universal.  Deliberate cruelty is always wrong, in every culture, every time, and every place; sometimes, causing pain is not cruel, i.e., surgery.

4. Morality is **Universal**. 
5. Morality is **reason driven**. "I cut him because I was giving life-saving surgery" versus "I just cut him for no reason." Some actions don't need to be justified, i.e., whistleing a little song, but some do, i.e., yelling at a friend to avoid an accident. Actions can be justified with reasons.

## What about...Emotion? 
 
Emotions follow but should not lead. I.e., love for family is part of morality; lacking it is a moral problem. But love for a friend should not obscure the duty to help/correct/take away their keys. 

</section><section data-markdown>

## What about...Conscience? 
 
Conscience is a reliable but fallible guide. It is "conditioned by our upbringing" and can be wrong, can be made numb, etc. Reason-driven arguments can correct or reinforce conscience.

## Four moral categories: 

- Obligatory  
- Permissible - Beneficial but not obligatory (supererogatory)  
- Permissible - Harmful but not prohibited   
- Prohibited  

Both (1) and (2) are "right" and maybe even (3). (4) is wrong. 

Examples: Is giving to charity (1) or (2)? Is smoking cigarettes (3) or (4)?

## Personal and Social

- **Three aspects of morality:** personal, social, and ultimate
- Example 1: individual ships, the fleet, and the safe harbor
- Example 2: players, the team, the sport itself
- Example 3: 
- **Personal**. Your own personal well-being, mental emotional physical spiritual etc. Virtues, eating habits, thought-life.
- **Social**.  How you treat others and are treated by others, including, legal status, friends, family, society, etc.
- **Ultimate**. What you are living for, ultimate values, how you are preparing for the end of life, the point of it all.

## Unresolved moral questions

Take a moment to consider and write down ONE moral question you are wrestling with.

1. Could be personal. Am I healthy? Good or bad? Should I change this habit?
2. Could be social. Is X right or wrong, permissible or not, am I being treated fairly, am I treating this person well? 
3. Could be ultimate. What is the meaning of life? Who is successful? What's it all about? 

DON'T HAVE TO TURN THIS IN.
