## What makes morality different?

1. Morality is **Evaluative, not descriptive.** Example: "John was driving at reckless speeds" vs. "John was driving 100." Morality also evaluates or judges.

1. Morality is **Evaluative, not descriptive.**
2. Morality is **Overriding**. "I should drive the speed limit" versus "I ought to drive faster to get to the heart attack victim." Moral laws override civil laws.

1. Morality is **Evaluative, not descriptive.**
2. Morality is **Overriding**. 
3. Morality is **Impartial**. "I should be friends with anyone I like, and don't have to be friends with anyone I don't like." versus "I should be nice to anyone I like and be mean to anyone I don't like." You can be partial about non-moral things but morality demands impartial treatment for moral equals. Morally relevant differences are exceptions -- felons can't vote!

1. Morality is **Evaluative, not descriptive.**
2. Morality is **Overriding**. 
3. Morality is **Impartial**. 
4. Morality is **Universal**. "Drive on the left side of the road in England," versus "Be hospitable to strangers in England." Non-moral norms are relative to time, place, culture, etc. But moral norms are universal.  Deliberate cruelty is always wrong, in every culture, every time, and every place; sometimes, causing pain is not cruel, i.e., surgery.

Morality is **Evaluative, not descriptive,**, **Overriding**, **Impartial**, **Universal**, and ...

5. Morality is **reason driven**. "I cut him because I was giving life-saving surgery" versus "I just cut him for no reason." Some actions don't need to be justified, i.e., whistleing a little song, but some do, i.e., yelling at a friend to avoid an accident. Actions can be justified with reasons.

## What about...Emotion? 
 
Emotions follow but should not lead. I.e., love for family is part of morality; lacking it is a moral problem. But love for a friend should not obscure the duty to help/correct/take away their keys. 

</section><section data-markdown>

## What about...Conscience? 
 
Conscience is a reliable but fallible guide. It is "conditioned by our upbringing" and can be wrong, can be made numb, etc. Reason-driven arguments can correct or reinforce conscience.

## Four moral categories: 

1. Obligatory
2a. Permissible - Beneficial but not obligatory (supererogatory)
2b. Permissible - Harmful but not prohibited 
3. Prohibited

Both (1) and (2) are "right" and maybe even (3). (4) is wrong. 

Is giving to charity (1) or (2)? Is smoking cigarettes (3) or (4)?

## Personal and Social

- Three aspects of morality: personal, social, and ultimate
- Example: individual ships, the fleet, and the safe harbor
- Example: players, the team, the sport itself

</section><section data-markdown>

## Unresolved moral questions

Take a moment to consider a moral question you are wrestling with. Is X right or wrong, permissable or
