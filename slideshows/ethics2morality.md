## Personal and Social

### **Three aspects of morality:** 

- **Personal**. Your own personal well-being, mental emotional physical spiritual etc. Virtues, eating habits, thought-life.
- **Social**.  How you treat others and are treated by others, including, legal status, friends, family, society, etc.
- **Ultimate**. What you are living for, ultimate values, how you are preparing for the end of life, the point of it all.

## Unresolved moral questions

Take a moment to consider and write down ONE moral question you are wrestling with.

1. Could be personal. Am I healthy? Good or bad? Should I change this habit?
2. Could be social. Is X right or wrong, permissible or not, am I being treated fairly, am I treating this person well? 
3. Could be ultimate. What is the meaning of life? Who is successful? What's it all about? 

THIS IS FOR YOU. DON'T HAVE TO TURN THIS IN.

## Lord of the Flies

- Lawlessness versus moral law
- Lawlessness is the "right of the mighty"; might makes right
- Moral law is the "might of the righteous"; right makes right
- Jack represents lawless power; Ralph represents law, morality, justice, culture
- "Civilization's power is weak and vulnerable to atavistic, volcanic passions." (32)

## Human Nature

- Are humans essentially good (who sometimes screw up)?
- Or are humans essentially evil (who sometimes cover up)?

- Good, bad, good (creation, fall, repentance)
- Bad, good, bad (creation, morality, exposure)

## Why Do We Need Morality?

- Hobbes: Without morality, mankind is in a constant state (or threat) of war and chaos. 
- Hobbes: With morality, mankind has civil law, government, security, peace, etc.
- Hobbes: The only "natural law" is that man is selfish. Morality = state law.
- Golding: Morality = natural law. Morality applies even if no state is enforcing it or can enforce it. 
- Pojman: Morality keeps society together, relieves suffering, promotes flourishing, resolves conflicts, rewards and punishes.

## Morality Gives us Reasons 


1. Morality is a set of reasons why we *have* to live a particular way. Piggy says, "I don't ask for my glasses back... because you're strong, but because what's right's right. Give me my glasses... you got to." (33)
1. Cause and effect explains everything *except* some human actions (example: Q: "Why is the tree lying there?" A: "The storm knocked it over." *Not* "it was tired.")
2. Human actions are explained by the rational relation of "grounds" of action. (Example (Q: "Why are you lying there?" A: "I'm doing yoga". *Not* "The storm knocked me over.")
