### Conclusion

- I have argued that there is a strong moral presumption against deception in business and professional life and have argued for the wrongess of a wide range of deceptive business and professional practices.
- Wrong... to fail to adequately inform those to whom they have fiduciary obligations. 
- Salespeople and other business and professional people who do not have fiduciary obligations to others still have substantial duties to offer information and give warnings. 
- THe Golden Rule tests for the permissibility of actions
