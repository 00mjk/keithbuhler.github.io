# Sex and Marriage 




</section> <!--Intro slide end-->
<section data-markdown>  <!--Slide Beginning-->



## Today

* Kant
* McMurtry
* Bayles



</section><section data-markdown>
### Kant

- Love of another is altruistic, human, and therefore good
- Sexual desire is not love, concerned for the other nor their humanity but only their biological sex, and therefore not good
- Sexual desire is suppressed by saints
- It is indulged in by the licentious, wicked, and bestial (think rapists, child molesters, serial adulterers, exhibitionists, flashers, etc)
- Inclination to another's biological sex dishonors their humanity and uses them for animal satisfaction

</section><section data-markdown>
### Kant

- The moral use of sexual desire would (a) not dishonor one's humanity, (b) indulge animal appetite, nor (c) merely use another person for one's own ends. 
- The only such moral use of sexual desire is monogamous marriage
- Monogamy is the free exchange of one's whole self for the other's whole self
- My body and soul belong to her, and her body and soul belong to me, and hence the use of them is not immoral
- The union in marriage is also *more than* sexual


</section><section data-markdown>
### Kant

>I have given myself up as the property of another, but in turn I take that other as my property, and so win myself back again in winning the person whose property I have become. In this way the two persons become a unity of will.... a union of human beings.


- Does this idea of oneness make sense? 
- Is reciprocal ownership of the other's body a suitable metaphor? 





</section><section data-markdown>
### McMurtry on Marriage

- Marriage seems like good sense, the laws of God, nature, Government, and society
- How could something be "divinely inspired, biologically determined, coerced, and reasoned out at the same time"? 

</section><section data-markdown>
### Four Laws

- **Legal Bindingness**: Partners are required to enter a formal contractual relation that cannot be dissolved without tremendous legal effort and cost
- **Monogamy**: The number of partners is two and only two, excluding wider intimacies
- **Exclusiveness**: No one may participate in more than one marriage at a time
- **Faithfulness:** No extramarital sexual relations are allowed

</section><section data-markdown>
### Four Laws

- Two and only two seems 'natural' to us
- If it's so natural why do all the weights of cultural prescription, from criminal law to housing regulation and tax codes, reinforce it?


</section><section data-markdown>
### Why marriage?

- Except God's will, there are two claims
- Marriage promotes affection -- could not any other form of union?
- Marriage is the context of child-rearing -- but what if they are bad parents? What if the marriage produces no children? What if another form of parenting works just as well? 
- (Objection: Beware the fallacy of "nothing buttery")


</section><section data-markdown>
### Attacks on marriage

1. Central control of marriage alienates partners
2. Restricts a child's sources of adult affection 
3. Promotes conjugal insecurity, jealousy
4. Prevents the strengths of larger groupings
5. Stimulates aggression, apathy, frustration, etc.
6. Maintains capitalist status quo
7. Keeps families small and powerless
7. Creates high demand for homes and consumer goods
8. Makes it necessary for men to work ("sell their labor")
9. Limits sexual satisfaction
10. Promotes financial profit of lawyers, priests, etc.

</section><section data-markdown>
### The Real Reason

- Marriage turns people into property
- All of our capitalist system "economizes" or "commodofies" non-commodities such as persons, art, beauty, friendship
- Marriage promotes and maintains capitalism






</section><section data-markdown>
### Reflections

- Marriage is the natural result of falling in love
- This author has never fallen in love



</section><section data-markdown>
### Bayles, Critique of McMurtry

- Current hedonism is vulgar, and rejected by Epicurus and Mill
- Hedonists and libertines appeal to "autonomy" to defend pre-marital intercourse, gay liberation, no-fault divorce, open adultery, polygamy, polyamory (and even pedophilia and incest) -- just not bestiality
- Is sexual satisfaction necessary or even helpful for eudaimonia and true human happiness?






</section><section data-markdown>
### Purpose of Marriage

- Procreation
- Companionship
- Legitimate expression of sexual desire


</section><section data-markdown>
### Penal laws and Private Laws

- Penal laws prohibit a behavior
- Private laws allow a behavior (prohibit the prohibition)
- Private laws legally recognize marriage, but do not ipso facto penalize any other relationship
- Non-monogamous activity is not recognized as marriage but does not "deprive people of a freedom they previously had"

### State Interest in Marraige

- Promoting love, trust, and friendship
- Agapic love is universal; erotic love is particular or limited
- Protecting children: the sociological and anecdotal data is overwhelming that two-parent male/female families are exponentially better for children


</section><section data-markdown>
### Children

1. Population control
2. Social interest in children's potential
3. Social responsibility for children (education, etc.)
4. "Disruption of family leave contributes to juvenile delinquicy"





</section><section data-markdown>
### The "Organic Whole" Argument

- Marriage and sex is the natural result of falling in love (McMurtry has never fallen in love), and children are the natural result of marriage and sex, and society is the natural result of children. 
- Social health is the natural result of this organic whole
- I.e., children with good childhoods with their parents who are healthy enough to contribute to society and form their own families through marriage and sexual fidelity and be good parents

</section><section data-markdown>
### The "Organic Whole" Argument

- No part of this whole can be artificially cut out from the whole organic cycle: 
- Sex without love is unfortunate and unhealthy (hurt feelings, STDs)
- Erotic love without marriage is unfortunate (insecurity, de facto marriage, de facto 'divorce')
- Marriage without children is unfortunate (infertility, immaturity)
- Children without marriage is unfortunate (crime, emotional stuntedness)
- And society without children is... well, extinct

</section><section data-markdown>
### The "Meaning" Argument

- By contrast, erotic love ruins all other forms of relationship except marriage; friends, family, children, animals, business relationships, government, etc. As Philip Mamalakis argues: a kiss *means* "I love you", a hug means "I have affection for you", erotic love *means* "I want to be with you forever".
