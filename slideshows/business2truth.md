# Week 2: Truth

### Some basics of scientific and philosophical thinking

</section><!--end slide-->
<section data-markdown>

## How is Kreeft's essay organized?

* Objections come first ("it seems")
* Then a pivot ("On the other hand")
* Then his thesis ("I answer")
* Then the proof of his thesis ("I argue that")
* Then he refutes to earlier objections ("Reply 1...")

</section> <section data-markdown>

## What is Kreeft's basic thesis? 

_Truth is real._

<aside class=notes>
- What is his question? Is truth objective? His answer is yes.
</aside>


</section><section data-markdown>

## "Objective"

An object is not something that depends on my thinking it.

So, it is possible to know what's what, and that no skeptical challenge to that possibility can stand up to scrutiny. 


</section> <section data-markdown>

## What is truth?

Saying of what is, that it is.

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Peter Kreeft, Summa Philosophica
### Q. VI, Article 2. Whether truth is objective? 

**Objection 1:** It seems that it is not, for people differ about what is truth, and that about which people differ is subjective. If truth were, objective, there would be no disagreements and arguments. But ordinary discourse is full of continual disagreements, which have never been resolved. If there were objective truth, they would have been resolved. Therefore there is no objective truth.



</section> <section data-markdown>

***On the contrary,*** if all truth were subjective, then that truth also would be subjective. But what is subjective is changeable and uncertain. Therefore if all truth were subjective, it would be changeable and uncertain, and thus that “truth” also — that all truth is changeable and uncertain — would be changeable and uncertain. But what is uncertain may be false, and what is changeable can be changed. Therefore the “truth” that all truth is subjective, is uncertain, and may be false; and it is changeable, and can be changed — and if changed, then changed to “truth is objective."

</section> <section data-markdown>


If it is only subjectively true that truth is subjective, or “true for you,” then the fact that that any supposed truth is “True for you”, subjectively, does not entail that it is true for all, objectively, or that it is true for me. And therefore it has no rational authority over me and I have no reason to believe it. On the other hand, if it is objectively true that truth is subjective, we have an immediate self-contradiction. 




</section> <section data-markdown>

I answer that what everyone means by truth is what Aristotle defined as “thinking and saying what is,” i.e. the conformity of what is believed to what is, or of thinking to being. 

</section> <section data-markdown>

For all alternative definitions of truth (e.g., the pragmatic concept of truth that “truth is what works,” or the coherence theory of truth, that “truth is the coherence of ideas with each other,” or the idealist theory of truth, that “truth is the conformity of what-is to thought”) claim that it is really the case that truth is what works, or what coheres, or the conformity of thing to thought rather than thought to thin. 

In other words, in arguing that their philosophy is the true one, they argue that what they believe corresponds to what is, thus they presuppose the common concept of truth as Aristotle defines it. And this is what people mean by “objective truth.” 

</section> <section data-markdown>

What persuades people otherwise is always some confusion between two or more of the following five questions:

Is this thing real? (yes or no)
If so, do we or can we know that this thing is real? (yes or no)
If so, is that knowledge certain rather than merely probably? (yes or no)
If so, can I convince others of that certainty by rational argument? (yes or no)
If so, does the argument use empirical methods? (yes or no)


</section> <section data-markdown>

- Is this thing real? **If not, then knowledge of it is not possible**
- If so, do we or can we know that this thing is real? **If not, a thing can be real without being known.** 
- If so, is that knowledge certain rather than merely probably? **If not, a thing can be known without being known with certainty.**
- If so, can I convince others of that certainty by rational argument? **If not, a certainty can be private rather than demonstrable.**
- If so, does the argument use empirical methods? **If not, then a proof or demonstration may use other methods than empirical ones.** 


</section> <section data-markdown>

## Objections

**Objection 1:** It seems that it is not, for people differ about what is truth, and that about which people differ is subjective. If truth were, objective, there would be no disagreements and arguments. But ordinary discourse is full of continual disagreements, which have never been resolved. If there were objective truth, they would have been resolved. Therefore there is no objective truth.

</section> <section data-markdown>


**Reply to objection 1:** All the premises of this argument are false. 

1. People do not differ totally but only partially, about what is truth. For if they differed totally, they could not argue, since all argument depends on agreed premises.
2. That about which peole differ is not necessarily subjective, for two students may get different answers to a math problem, yet one is objectively correct and the other incorrect.
3.  It is also not truth that “if truth were objective, then there would be no disagreements about it.” In fact, only if truth is objective can there be disagreements about it. People do not argue about strictly subjective things. We never hear arguments like: “I feel sick!” “No! I feel well.”

</section> <section data-markdown>

* **Objection 2:** Even granted that objective truth exists in science, for scientists do come to universal or nearly universal agreement, this is not the case in philosophy. For there is no philosophical teaching about which all philosophers agree. Therefore there is no objective truth in philosophy. 
* **Reply to Objection 2:**  Universal agreement is neither the cause nor the criterion of truth. For it is possible the fools universally agree on something false. And as Socrates showed, those who do not admit the possibility that they're fools are the greatest of fools. But just as there are things fools agree on that are false, there are things that fools do not agree on that are true.


</section> <section data-markdown>

* **Objection 3:** Even granted that objective truth exists in philosophy, it does not follow that we can know it. For if truth is objective, its existence does not depend on our knowing it, while if it is subjective, it exists only in our knowledge of it. Thus only if truth is subjective is it by definition knowable, while if it is objective it is independent of our knowledge and beyond it rather than in it, and this does us no good. 

</section> <section data-markdown>


* **Reply to Objection 3:** 
1. The argument confuses two senses of the word “in” When it speaks of truth being “in” our knowledge: (a) as received into the order of our subjective knowing from without, i.e., from the order of objective being, and (b) as generated by, or at least dependent on, and not independent of, our subjective knowing. It is true that if truth is objective it could be unknown, while if it is subjective it is by definition known. But this does not prove that it is unknown. 
2. As skepticism denies that anyone can know they are right, subjectivism denies that anyone can be wrong. They are equally self-refuting. 



</section> <section data-markdown>

* **Objection 4:** To claim that we can know objective truth is to assume that we want to know it, or ought to know it. But Nietzsche, in an unprecedented flight of boldness, questions even this “will to truth” when he asks: “Why truth? Why not rather untruth?” 



</section> <section data-markdown>

### Three senses of "Truth"

|Name            |  Sense         |    Example       |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Substantive Truth | Reality itself |          Mount Everest being a mountain. |
| Knowledge       |  Thinking truly  |         Mount Everest is a mountain. |
| True words      |  Speaking truly  |         “Mount Everest is a mountain.” |




</section> <section data-markdown>

>“Truth is saying of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not.” (Aristotle)

Reality —>              Thought —>        Expression in language 

Truth itself                  True thought           True statement

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Nihilism

* What is the opposite of truth? 
* The denial of truth — objective truth — is nihilism, the denial of reality itself. 
* Hence, Gorgias of Athens said: 

>Nothing exists;

> Even if something exists, nothing can be known about it; and

> Even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it can't be communicated to others.

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Nihilism

Hence, also, Nietszsche: 

>*“It is true, there could be a metaphysical world; the absolute possibility of it is hardly to be disputed. We behold all things through the human head and cannot cut off this head; while the question nonetheless remains what of the world would still be there if one had cut it off.”* 

*Human, All Too Human*, s.9, R.J. Hollingdale transl.

# Week 2: The Moral law

**None of you are moral relativists!**

</section><section data-markdown>

## Basic issue

* Is the moral law unreal or real? 
* Are laws like "human beings do not steal" just as real as laws like "apples grow on apple trees"? 

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Peter Kreeft, Are Moral laws objectively real? 


</section> <section data-markdown>

## Real Moral Laws

On the contrary, all men, in all times, places, and cultures, argue about whether certain acts, both in general and in particular, are morally right or wrong. We argue about objective truth, not about subjective feelings. Therefore, unless all men are wrong all the time in moral argumentation, moral rightness and wrongness are objective. The moral laws define and discriminate more rightness and wrongness. Therefore moral laws are objective. 

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Real Moral Laws

The very premise that the moral subjectivist uses most frequently to prove his conclusion, namely disagreements and continual argument about morality, proves the opposite. For we do not argue about (1) purely subjective matters, like pains and pleasures, nor about (2) objective matters that are easy to resolve, like counting the pages of a book, but only about (3) objective matters that are not easy to resolve. 

</section> <section data-markdown>

I answer that to call moral law “objective” is not to call it a thing or entity, like a cat, but to call it objectively true, like the laws of physics or mathematics. Just as different physical roads lead to different physical destinations, So that it is impossible to get to the Pacific ocean by walking east from Chicago, no matter how subjectively sincere and passionate you are; and just as it is impossible to get an odd number by adding up only even numbers, no matter how subjectively sincere and passionate you are, so it is impossible to get to moral goodness, or true happiness, or beatitude, by choosing evil and refusing good, no matter how subjectively sincere and passionate you are.

</section> <section data-markdown>

We discover moral truths rather than invent them, just as we discover physical, mathematical, or philosophical truths. This is immediately evident in ordinary human experience and needs no elaborate proof. “Conscience” is the usual word for the mental power by which we are aware of, and feel the obligation to obey, Real moral walls. We discover or “bump into” the goodness and badness of human acts as we “bump into” curbs or colors, though not with our material senses. The act of experiencing or discovering a moral obligation is indeed subjective, but the object of the act is not. If it were in would not be an obligation but only an “ideal” to us, i.e. a subjective desire. (My ideals need not be yours.)

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Some Examples of Moral Laws

* 'I have not slain men.' (Ancient Egyptian. From the Confession of the Righteous Soul, 'Book of the Dead', v. Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics f= ERE], vol. V, p. 478)
* 'Nature urges that a man should wish human society to exist and should wish to enter it.' (Roman. Cicero, De Ojficiis, i. iv)
* 'Brothers shall fight and be each others' bane.' (Old Norse. Account of the Evil Age before the World's end, Volospd 45)
* 'Your father is an image of the Lord of Creation, your mother an image of the Earth. For him who fails to honour them, every work of piety is in vain. This is the first duty.' (Hindu. Janet, i. 9)
* 'Nature produces a special love of offspring' and 'To live according to Nature is the supreme good.' (Roman. Cicero, De Off. i. iv, and De Legibus, i. xxi)

</section> <section data-markdown>


## Some Examples of Moral Laws (cont'd)

* 'I saw in Nastrond (= Hell)... beguilers of others' wives.' (Old Norse. Volospd 38, 39)
* 'I have not stolen.' (Ancient Egyptian. Confession of the Righteous Soul. EREy. 478)
* 'Do no unrighteousness in judgement. You must not consider the fact that one party is poor nor the fact that the other is a great man.' (Ancient Jewish. Leviticus 19:15)

</section> <section data-markdown>






**Objection 1:** It seems that they are not, for things that are objectively real are agreed to by everyone, eventually. But moral laws are not agreed to by everyone, but argued about in all times and places. Therefore they are not objective. This agreement proves subjectivity. If moral values were objective, there would be an objective way of determining them and settling moral arguments. But there is not.

**Reply to Objection 1:** 
1. It is not true that subjective things are always argued about. On the contrary, it is only objective things that are argued about. No one argues about private, subjective feelings. No one responds to “I feel well” with, “No, you feel sick.”

</section> <section data-markdown>

**Reply to Objection 1 (cont'd):** 

1. It is not true that subjective things are always argued about. On the contrary, it is only objective things that are argued about. No one argues about private, subjective feelings. No one responds to “I feel well” with, “No, you feel sick.”
2. It is not agreed to by everyone is not objective. This is false also. For instance, no discovery of science was agreed to by everyone before it was proved to be true (e.g. the roundness of the earth, or the origin of disease in germs); yet if it was a true discovery, it was an objective truth.
3.  Fundamental moral principles are one of the few things that are agreed to by everyone, or nearly everyone. No one believes that murder, theft, and adultery are morally right. People differ only about whether a certain war is an example of murder, a certain tax and example of theft, or a certain flirtation a case of adultery.

</section> <section data-markdown>

**Reply to Objection 1:** 

4.  Disagreement does not prove subjectivity. If it did but a single person who did not agree that 2+2 = 4 would make that judgment subjective. The reason men disagree about moral values is twofold: their own subjective ignorance and passion, and the objective nature of moral values, which are more complex and demanding than empirical or mathematical facts.

</section> <section data-markdown>

**Objection 2:** Moral law is spiritual: it has no size, shape, weight, or color. Spirit exists in subjective consciousness, not in the objective universe, which is material, having size, shape, weight, And color. What exists in subjective consciousness is not objective. Therefore moral law is not objective.

**Reply to Objection 2:** All just exist only in subjective consciousness, including judgments about material things like size, judgments about mathematical truths, and judgments about moral laws. But the objects of these judgments, unlike feelings, are objective. That is why we argue about them. 


</section> <section data-markdown>

* **Objection 3:**  Moral laws are values. Values are not facts, for they are about what ought to be, or about the obligations we have, not about what is. Therefore moral values are not facts. But what is objectively real consists only in facts. Therefore moral laws are not objectively real, because of the “fact-value" distinction. 

- **Reply to Objection 3:** If “facts” means “empirical facts only,” then it is not true that was it objectively real consist only of facts, except according to materialism; for the existence of God, other minds, angels, and mathematical truths are all objectively real, but not empirical. If, on the other hand, “facts” means “Whatever is objectively real,” the argument begs the question in assuming that moral values are not facts. They are facts about what our real duties, laws, obligations, rights, and goods are. That is why we can argue about them, and why we argue about them. The "fact value distinction" is not absolute. 


</section> <section data-markdown>

- **Objection 4:** Let us analyze a moral situation. You witnessed a murder. You make the judgment that "that act was bad" or "that man is evil." But all that actually happens is that one man shoots another man dead. The value judgment of evil is not in the gun or the bullet or the trigger finger but giving you the observer. "That act was bad" that's really means I have bad feelings about that act.
- **Reply to Objection 4:** the analysis does not fit the situation, and less one is a material list. An act of murder has a material quality and data, but it also has a moral quality. It is the act itself to be rightly judged to be evil, not our feelings. If it were our feelings, then"your act is evil” would really mean"my feelings are evil,"which is absurd. We feel righteous, not wicked, when we meet a murderer. 


</section> <section data-markdown>

- **Objection 5:** Moral questions are a major part of philosophy’s great classic questions. But it was already admitted that philosophies great questions are “mysteries" rather than “problems,” and that mysteries were questions in which are subjective involvement made definite, final solutions and possible. Therefore moral questions are not objective.
- **Reply to Objection 5:** “Mysteries” do not mean totally subjective questions questions in which we are personally involved, though in themselves they were about the objective and universal truths.

# Week 2: Business and Religion

### Godliness, godlessness, and morality

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Goals today

1. Get some context on religion in the U.S. and the world.
2. Apply that to business. 
3. Discuss the ways religion affects ethics. 


</section><section data-markdown>

## Intro

+ Most people are religious; that is, they adhere to a particular religious tradition and/or they believe that the universe was created or sustained by God. 
+ Religion and ethics have a complex relationship. 



</section> <section data-markdown>

## Your perceptions

Ask yourself: 

- How many people are religious?   
- How many people are secular?
- How many people are immoral?
- How many people are moral?


</section> <section data-markdown>

## Religion and public morality

![Religion](/images/religion-in-us-small.png)

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Religion and public morality

In the US Today:^[Pew Religious Landscape Survey, http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/] 

- 78% Religious 
- 22% non-Religious

Specifically:

- 68% Christian
- 10% other religious affiliation 
- 22% unaffiliated total
including atheists (5-8%), agnostics, humanists, 
and “spiritual but not religious” nones (5-8%). 


</section> <section data-markdown>

## Religion and public morality

In the US Today: 

- In general, 7 out of 10 people are religious. 
- In general, 2 out of 10 people are unaffiliated, spiritual, agnostic, or atheist. 

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Religion and public morality


**Exceptions**

- Academia (50% religious)
- Philosophy (15% religious)
- Science (42% religious)
- Kentucky (76% Christian)
- Entertainment industry?
- News Media?

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Religion and public morality

- US 78% religious

Compare with: 

- The Czech Republic, 21% religious
- Sweden and Denmark 17%-18% religious
- US is 5-8% atheist; Japan is 31% atheist

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Religion and public morality

So how does this affect business? 

Some businesses are composed of mostly religious people; some are composed of mostly secular people. 

Some businesses take a public stand on religion. Others don't. 

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Religious Businesses: 

Chick Fil-A  
Tyson  
Forever 21  
Mary Kay  
Alaska Airlines  
Hobby Lobby  
Tom’s   
Salvation Army  
AA  

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Non-religious Businesses:
Starbucks  
Popeye’s  
Michael’s  
GoodWill  
Rational Recovery  

</section> <section data-markdown>

But when it comes to their ethics, most people take some cues from their religion. 

How does religion affect morality? 

One major answer is: divine command theory

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Divine command theory

- Divine Command Theory is the view that morality in some way depends on God or the divine. 
- “(i) God in some sense determines what is moral; 
- (ii) moral obligations are derived from God’s commands, where these commands are understood as statements of the revealed divine will.”

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Divine command theory
- The straightforward version of Divine Command Theory is the Judeo-Christian version where God tells his people how to live and what not to do. 
- That is not the only version, however. 
- It might be that we know how to live and what not to do even without divine commands; 
- It might be that god gives commands for other reasons than knowledge, such as encouragement. 

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Divine command theory

* Michael Austin: “Divine Command Theory has been and continues to be highly controversial. It has been criticized by numerous philosophers, including Plato, Kai Nielsen, and J. L. Mackie. 
* The theory also has many defenders, both classic and contemporary, such as Thomas Aquinas, Robert Adams, and Philip Quinn. 
* The question of the possible connections between religion and ethics is of interest to moral philosophers as well as philosophers of religion, but it also leads us to consider the role of religion in society as well as the nature of moral deliberation. Given this, the arguments offered for and against Divine Command Theory have both theoretical and practical importance.”

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Divine command theory - Possible advantages 

1. Immanuel Kant argues that "we must believe that God exists because the requirements of morality are too much for us to bear. We must believe that there is a God who will help us satisfy the demands of the moral law. With such a belief, we have the hope that we will be able to live moral lives." (Austin)
2.  That is, if the origin of the universe is a personal moral being, then the existence of objective moral truths are at home, so to speak, in the universe. By contrast, if the origin of the universe is non-moral, then the existence of such truths becomes philosophically perplexing, because it is unclear how moral properties can come into existence via non-moral origins.

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Divine command theory - Possible disadvantages
1. Egoism Problem — The motive for being moral might become merely to avoid punishment or gain bliss. 
2. Euthyphro Dilemma. - Should we love one another because God commands us to do so? Or does God commands us to love one another because that is what we ought to do?

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Euthyphro dilemma

We ought to love one another because God commands us to do so.  
<p class=fragment> 
*But what if he commands something immoral? Moral truths seem to be necessary truths.*
</p>
<p class=fragment> 
God commands us to love one another because that is what we ought to do. </p>
<p class=fragment> 
*But then moral goodness is independent of God, and he is subject to it.*
</p>


</section> <section data-markdown>

### Goodness without god

What are secular/humanist alternatives? 

- “Fundamentalists correctly perceive that universal moral standards are required for the proper functioning of society. But they erroneously believe that God is the only possible source of such standards. 
- Philosophers as diverse as Plato, Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, George Edward Moore, and John Rawls have demonstrated that it is possible to have a universal morality without God. 
- Contrary to what the fundamentalists would have us believe, then, what our society really needs is not more religion but a richer notion of the nature of morality.”[^1]

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Goodness without god


1. Cultural relativism — to each his own. 
2. Amoralism — do what works. 
3. Vitalism — whatever is beautiful and lively is good (Dorian Gray)
4. Scientific ethics — do what is objectively good for people.
5. Natural law — ethics grounded in the laws human nature.



</section> <section data-markdown>

### Goodness without god

<p class=fragment> 
1. Cultural relativism — to each his own. 
- Objection: Cannot criticize other immoral cultures. </p>

<p class=fragment> 
2. Amoralism — do what works. 
      - Objection: Counterintuitive; we know we should not do what works if it’s wrong.</p>

<p class=fragment> 
3. Vitalism — do whatever is beautiful and lively and exciting  (Dorian Gray)
      - Objection:  Simply immoral. </p>
<p class=fragment> 
4. Scientific ethics — do what is objectively good for people.
      - Objection: How to resolve disagreements about the nature of science? 
      - Objection: “Flourishing” — what is it? Humility or pride? </p>

</section>
<section data-markdown>

### Natural law, a compromise

7. Natural law — ethics grounded in the laws human nature.
      - Objection: Identify basic goods: life, friendship, knowledge, freedom.
      - Objection: Identify basic moral duties and prohibitions: do good, avoid evil, harm no one. 
     -  Negotiate less basic goods: how much freedom? Etc. 

</section> <section data-markdown>

## Business and Religion: Summary

1. Most people are religious.
2. Almost everybody has a moral sense, whether they are religious or not. 
3. Almost everybody is morally decent most of the time.
3. Businesses must be ethical businesses. 
4. How are they ethical? Does God figure in or not? 
5. If so, then what is the role of divine commands in public life?
6. If not, then how does the natural law apply to business?

Next week, we’ll discuss Utilitarianism, the theory that pleasure is the only good and needs to be maximized.
