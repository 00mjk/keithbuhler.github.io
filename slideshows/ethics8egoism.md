### Why Be Moral?

1. Good for me, and Morally good     | (justice?)
2. Not Good for me, but Morally Good | (saving child's life)
2. Good for me, but not Morally Good | (killing enemies)
2. Not Good for me, and not Morally Good | (murder-suicide)

### Plato, the Ring of Gyges

- (1) Good for something else (exercise, medicine); (2) Good for its own sake (pleasure) and (3) Both (knowledge, sight, health) -- Is justice 1 or 3? 
- If one could be invisible, "No man would be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice" (500).
- Perfectly unjust and a reputation for justice, vs. perfectly just and a reputation for injustice

### Thesis: Morality requires self-interest and life

- I argue that morality is mind and life. 
- "To remain alive, he  must think" (506)
- Life is good, death evil
- "It is only a to a living entity that things can be good or evil" because only living things are fragile, vulnerable, destructible
- A rational being must act according to values
- The ultimate value is "Man's Life"

### Thesis: Morality requires self-interest and life

- Acting contrary to your life is irrational and suicidal"Rational being or suicidal animal"
- "Man's life is the *standard of morality* but your own life is its *purpose*" (507)
- Happiness is the "successful state of life"

### Objection: "Morality" requires you kill yourself

1. It seems that morality requires you suppress your happiness and self-interest for the sake of helping others. 
- "A doctrine that gives you, as an ideal, the role of a sacrificial animal seeking slaughter on the altars of others, is giving you *death* as your standard" (507)
- Man is not merely an animal following instincts (508)

### Objection: "Morality" requires you kill yourself

- "Sweep aside those hatred-eaten mystics, who pose as friends of humanity and preach that the highest virtue man can practice is to hold his own life as of no value" (508)
- "The good of others" is a "magic formula that transforms anything into gold"; the mere intention baptizes your actions, as long as it is non-good for me. 
- "If *you* wish it, it's evil; if others wish it, it's good."

### Objection: "Morality" requires you kill yourself

- "As this double-jointed, double-standard morality splits you in half, so it splits mankind into two enemy camps: one is *you*, the other is all the rest of humanity" (509)


</section><section data-markdown>
### Objection: "Morality" requires you kill yourself

- "Consolation prize and booby-trap": your joy comes from giving it up to others; protecting your life by protecting all others
- Rand: *Why?* (509-10)
