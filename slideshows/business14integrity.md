# Organizational Integrity



</section> <!--Intro slide end-->
<section data-markdown>  <!--Slide Beginning-->


### Question

How can an organization or corporation (a group), rather than merely individuals in that organization, have integrity? 

</section><section data-markdown>

### Thesis



- An organization that is ethical is one with integrity
- An organization with integrity has a "a certain sort of moral climate" (701)
- _Corporate_ integrity has something in common with personal (faithfulness to one's principles)
- But corporate integrity has some unique features personal integrity cannot have (a climate or culture)


</section><section data-markdown>

## Summary of Arguments

### A "moral climate" is...

- (a) the "shared perceptions of prevailing organizational norms" pertaining to moral issues
- (b) a good method for dealing with moral wrongs and failings
- Such norms and methods are "built in" to the structure of the organization and actually lived out by people
- Which norms exactly? 


</section><section data-markdown>

### Norms and Values

A good moral climate has at least four norms: 

1. Concern for stakeholders connected to the organization
2. Cooperation within the organization
3. Fairness to all involved
4. And a proper attitude toward incentives


</section><section data-markdown>

### Norm 1: Stakeholder management

- Of course you must be committed to your organization's purpose in the face of adversity
- But you must also have a good purpose
- And (according to Bowie) be a "value-creating institution"

</section><section data-markdown>

### Objection 1: Friedman

- Isn't it enough to achieve the organization's purpose, be that what it may?
- Isn't the moral manager the one who gets the job done and serves stockholders? 
- Bowie is setting this possibility aside and assuming stakeholder theory

### What is a business? (704)

- A business is not just an economic community (of means) but a moral community (of ends)
- The organization's cooperative social union is not just practically necessary; it is an intrinsic good

</section><section data-markdown>

### Seven Norms

1. Consider all affected stakeholders
2. Participation of ruled in ruling
3. No single stakeholder's interest always trumps others
4. It should not always be that the majority interest trumps 
5. Always treat people as ends in themselves
6. It's an (imperfect) duty to make profits to benefit society
7. Create procedures to implement justice

</section><section data-markdown>

### Norm 2: Fairness (Substantive)

- Equitably distribute "surplus" (as in negotiation of house price)
- Proportionality versus equality -- contribute more, receive more
- If there is no way to measure or quantify, then distribute equally
- Everyone contributes work so everyone should benefit from success

### Coca-Cola example

- Is a Coke vending machine that raises the price on a hot day "unfair"?

## Objections


</section><section data-markdown>

## Reflections

- What is "surplus?" If I'm willing to pay $520,000 for your house, and you're willing to sell for $500,000, why should strength of will determine?
- Accepting "proportionality" is denying "equality"
- There are ways to measure qualitative degrees without quantifying them (more/less love, more/less red, more/less beauty)
