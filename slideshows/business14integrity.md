# Organizational Integrity



</section> <!--Intro slide end-->
<section data-markdown>  <!--Slide Beginning-->


### Question

How can an organization or corporation (a group), rather than merely individuals in that organization, have integrity? 

### Thesis



- An organization that is ethical is one with integrity
- An organization with integrity has a "a certain sort of moral climate" (701)
- _Corporate_ integrity has something in common with personal (faithfulness to one's principles)
- But corporate integrity has some unique features personal integrity cannot have (a climate or culture)

## Summary of Arguments

### A "moral climate" is...

- (a) the "shared perceptions of prevailing organizational norms" pertaining to moral issues
- (b) a good method for dealing with moral wrongs and failings
- Such norms and methods are "built in" to the structure of the organization and actually lived out by people
- Which norms exactly? 

### Norms and Values

A good moral climate has at least four norms: 

1. Concern for stakeholders connected to the organization
2. Cooperation within the organization
3. Fairness to all involved
4. And a proper attitude toward incentives

### Norm 1: Stakeholder management

- Of course you must be committed to your organization's purpose in the face of adversity
- But you must also have a good purpose
- And (according to Bowie) be a "value-creating institution"


### Objection 1: Friedman

- Isn't it enough to achieve the organization's purpose, be that what it may?
- Isn't the moral manager the one who gets the job done and serves stockholders? 
- Bowie is setting this possibility aside and assuming stakeholder theory

### What is a business? (704)

- A business is not just an economic community (of means) but a moral community (of ends)
- The organization's cooperative social union is not just practically necessary; it is an intrinsic good

### Seven Norms

1. Consider all affected stakeholders
2. Participation of 

### Norm 2: Cooperative Purpose

### Norm 3: Fairness

- Substantive norms
- Procedural norms

### Norm 4: Incentives

### Norm 5: Profit
