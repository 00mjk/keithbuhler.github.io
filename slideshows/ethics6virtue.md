### 1. Virtue ethics originated with Aristotle.

- It originated (in the west) with Aristotle, Plato, Socrates and other Greeks
- (In the east) with Confucious, Laozi and others.

### 2. The highest good is happiness. 

- We want pleasure, honor, wealth etc. for the sake of something else. They are not "self-sufficient". 
- We want happiness (eudaimonia) *for its own sake*. 
- Happiness is not pleasure; though most people treat it as such (318)
- Happiness is "something final and self-sufficient and the end of all action." (320)

### 3. Happiness is "an activity of soul in accordance with perfect virtue." 

- In other words, virtue ethics says that the good life, happiness, well-being, is only possible for the virtuous and wise person.
- Every natural or artificial object has a function
- The function of man is not life (which is shared with plants), sensation (with animals), but something rational.
- "The function of man then is activity of soul in accordance with reason" (320).  
- "Happiness is an activity of soul in accordance with perfect virtue."

### 4. There are moral and intellectual virtues. 

- Aristotle says: "Virtues" are good habits of feeling, action, and thought." The goal is ‘to feel [desires and emotions] at the right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right people, with the right motive, and in the right way’. 
- Excess and defect destroys (heat/cold, obesity/starvation, wet/dry)
- Hence, moral virtues concern intermediate between excess and deficiency. 
- Intellectual virtues assist you in judging true and false.

### 5. There are individual virtues (such as moderation) and social virtues (such as justice).

- Some virtues have to do with how I comport myself even when no one is looking. On a desert island, I could be virtuous or vice-ridden. 
- Other virtues have to do with how I comport myself in society. I can't be unjust to others if no others are around. I owe respect to my elders, but can't if I am the eldest. I owe care to my children, but can't if I don't have children.

### 6. Ethics is not just about actions but about the whole of life. 
- Ethical dilemmas are crucially important in Utilitarianism and Deontology.
- In virtue ethics, dilemmas are still important, but not  *as important* as daily life. Daily life is about setting priorities, pursuing them, and thinking long-term. 
- The primary question is: "how should I live?" What kind of life should I live? 
- For example, what major goods should I pursue? What career should I choose? Marriage or no? Kids or no? Where should I live? 
- "By doing brave acts we become brave."

### 7. Applying virtues takes practical wisdom. 

1. A general conception of what is good or bad (conditions for human flourishing);
2. The ability to perceive, in light of that general conception, what is required in terms of feeling, choice, and action in a particular situation; 
3. and the ability to act on that deliberation. 

</section><section data-markdown>

### 7. Applying virtues takes practical wisdom. 

- Ethics is not subjective; it is ‘context-sensitive’. 
- There are few safe generalizations about right and wrong. 
- Practical wisdom is a form of intuitive reason. It is a "know how" rather than a "know that". 
- Practical wisdom cannot be taught, but must be acquired through experience. Like piano playing, tennis, or making conversation.

### 8. The 'function' of humanity has to do with our rationality. 

What is it that humans do but no other creature does? 

- Not life -- plants are alive, reproduce, grow, etc.
- Not consciousness -- animals are conscious
- Rational choice -- only humans make rational choices on the basis of reflection. We judge what is true or false, good or bad, and act accordingly. We deliberate and act.

- Should I move to Canada or stay in the U.S.? I can only answer that if I know what each place is like, and how well each place would fit my goals and allow me to acquire more virtue.

### MacIntyre, Virtue and practice

1. Virtues vary in cultures, traditions -- but there is a core.
2. Virtues depend "on some prior account of ... social and moral life" (336).

### Virtue and practice

- Virtues "enable us to achieve the goods in practices"  (340)
- A practices is "any coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative human activity" pursuing the goods of that activity
- Tic-tac-toe is not a practice, throwing a ball is not a practice
- A practice is not just a technical skill (342)


</section><section data-markdown>

### Virtue and practice
- Chess is a practice, football is a practice, portrait painting is a practice
- The good of chess includes winning and playing well
- A practice has its own ends, and standards 
- Vices disable us to succeed in practices
- Practices are not just institutions (344)
- Virtues and truthfulness may prevent one from becoming rich (345)

</section><section data-markdown>

### Seneca

- Living well, not just living
- The quality, not quantity of life
- Dying well


</section><section data-markdown>

### Epictetus

- The "fundamental distinction" between what is in my control and out of my control
- I control: perception, intention, desire, aversion, my own doings
- I do not control: body, property, reputation, political office, not my own doings. 
- Desire and aversion make you unfortunate, because you cannot control them
- The idea of things is upsetting, not things themselves
- Don't take pride in anything out of your control ("I have a fine horse")
- Never say you have "lost it" but "given it back." You received it for a time, and gave it back
