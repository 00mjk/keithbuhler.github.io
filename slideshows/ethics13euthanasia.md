## Key Terms 1

* "eu" (good) + "thanatos" (death)
* Tension between taking innocent life and avoiding agony

</section><section data-markdown>

### Key Terms 2

* Voluntary euthanasia (decided by patient, i.e., suicide)
* Nonvoluntary euthanasia (decided by kin)
* Involuntary euthanasia (decided by another, i.e., murder)

</section><section data-markdown>

### Key Terms 3
* Active -- "Mercy killing" -- through lethal drug
* Passive -- unplugging respirator or withholding fluids
* Active is generally illegal, and medical assocations oppose it
* Passive is generally legal, either voluntary or nonvoluntary (e.g., comatose)

Question: Is euthanasia morally defensible? 

Thesis: Although it seems that euthanasia is murder or suicide, voluntary active euthanasia is morally permissible due to values of self-determination (or autonomy) and well-being, and should be legally allowed


Arguments:

1. Death is scary and painful
3. Deciding when to die allows one to "avoid great suffering, maintain one's dignity, insure that others remember us as we wish them to" (763)


Objections: 

1. Well-being conflicts with autonomy, because autonomy presupposes being alive -- response: it is possible to judge that one's own life is no longer worth living. 
2. Clinical depression can "call into question whether the patient has made a competent choice" -- safeguards must be in place. 
3. Euthanasia is the taking of an innocent life

Reflections: 

1. Suicide is already "legal". Asking for someone else to help you is not. Legalizing euthanasia would make some murders legally permitted... and incentivized.
