## Defense of Euthanasia 




</section> <!--Intro slide end-->
<section data-markdown>  <!--Slide Beginning-->


## Key Terms 1

* "eu" (good) + "thanatos" (death)
* Tension between taking innocent life and avoiding agony

</section><section data-markdown>

### Key Terms 2

* Voluntary euthanasia (decided by patient, i.e., suicide)
* Nonvoluntary euthanasia (decided by kin)
* Involuntary euthanasia (decided by another, i.e., murder)

</section><section data-markdown>

### Key Terms 3
* Active -- "Mercy killing" -- through lethal drug
* Passive -- unplugging respirator or withholding fluids
* Active is generally illegal, and medical assocations oppose it
* Passive is generally legal, either voluntary or nonvoluntary (e.g., comatose)

</section><section data-markdown>

### Key Terms 4

* "Doctrine of Double Effect" -- Intend A to bring about B and C vs. intend A to bring about B but not C, even though it is possible to predict C will come about.

### Brock:  Is euthanasia morally defensible? 

1. Death is scary and painful
2. Deciding when to die is one's autonomous choice 
5. So should the law stop people from getting help from their physician? 
6. And does morality prevent the physician from helping? 

</section><section data-markdown>

Thesis: Although it seems that euthanasia is murder or suicide, voluntary active euthanasia is morally permissible due to values of self-determination (or autonomy) and well-being, and should be legally allowed


</section><section data-markdown>


### Arguments:

1. Deciding when to die allows one to "avoid great suffering, maintain one's dignity, insure that others remember us as we wish them to" (763)
1. Well-being conflicts with autonomy, because autonomy presupposes being alive -- response: it is possible to judge that one's own life is no longer worth living. 
2. Clinical depression can "call into question whether the patient has made a competent choice" -- safeguards must be in place.

### Objections: 

3. Euthanasia is the deliberate killing of an innocent person 
4. Response: Killing is just as bad as letting die, which is legal and sometimes permissible


### The ALS case. 

- If the patient wishes to be unplugged from a respirator, this is not murder or suicide, just 'letting her die'.
- If the patient's son unplugs her, it is murder (even though he merely 'let her die')
- The difference is consent, legal authorization, and motive


### The Drowing case

- You can't swim. We're on a boat. If I push you in, that's "killing."
- You can't swim. We're on a boat. You fall in. I don't throw you a life ring. That's "killing."


### Reflections: 

1. Suicide is already "legal". Asking for someone else to help you is not. Legalizing euthanasia would make some murders legally permitted... and incentivized.
