#  Autonomy


</section> <!--Intro slide end-->
<section data-markdown>  <!--Slide Beginning-->



## MLK, "I have a dream"

1. Is his dream realized?
2. Is affirmative action contrary to his dream? 
3. What does equality look like?

### Milgram, Experiment in Autonomy

1. A basic experiment in autonomy (self-rule) versus obedience (other-rule)
2. "Learners" were actors, "Teachers" were real people
2. "Teachers" were told by a scientist to shock the Learners. 
3. Would they obey their conscience or the scientist?








</section><section data-markdown>
### Results

- 60% of Yale undergrades were "fully obedient"
- 60% of general public in New Haven were the same
- 60-85% of subjects were obedient in Munich, Rome, South Africa, Australia, etc.

### Case Studies

1. Brandt protested and politely refused to continue (582)
2. Prozi protested but continued, upset and quickly (584)
3. Braverman protested but continued, giggling and feeling guilty (587)

>There was I. I'm a nice person, I think, hurting somebody, and caught up in what seemed a mad situation... and in the interest of science, one goes through with it. My reactions were awfully peculiar... giggly, trying to stifle laughter... This was a sheer reaction to a totally impossible situation... My wife said 'you can call yourself Eichmann'."

### Interpretation

1. Is everyone just aggressive, waiting for an excuse? 
2. Let's try again where the Teacher is free to select the voltage
3. The average shock then was 60 volts (on a scale of 40-450)
4. This supports Hannah Arendt's argument, in *Eichmann in Jerusalem*, that evil is "banal" (trite, unoriginal, boring)
5. "Eichman was an uninspired bureaucrat" sitting at his desk and doing his job

### Responsibility

1. Batta "did his honest best", obeyed, and compared himself to the obstinate learner
2. Responsibility for one's action, rather than fulfilling someone else's orders, matters.
3. Responsibility for one part of the torture, rather than the torture directly, matters (592)
4. The less one can relinquish authority to a peer or authority, the more one feels the pressure of responsibility






</section><section data-markdown>
### Variations

1. Physical presence (vs telephone) lessened obedience
2. Conflicting authority (vs expert consensus) ceased obedience 
3. Social pressure (vs peer consensus) lessened obedience







</section><section data-markdown>
### The Social Structure

>"The fragmentation of the total human act" where "no one is confronted with the consequences of his decision to carry out the evil act" is perhaps "the most common characteristic of socially organized evil in modern society" (592)
