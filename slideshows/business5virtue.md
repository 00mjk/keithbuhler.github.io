# Week 5: Virtue Ethics

*"Where Excellence is a Habit"*


</section><section data-markdown>

## Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book I (Selections)

>Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason THE GOOD has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim. Some ends are activities in themselves, while others are results apart from the activities that produce them. Where there are ends apart from the activities, the result is better than the activities…. 

>… If, then, there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for its own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this), and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good and the chief good. 

>…. Verbally there is very general agreement; for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is happiness, and identify living well and doing well with being happy; but with regard to what happiness is they differ, and the majority do not give the same account as the wise. For the former think it is some plain and obvious thing, like pleasure, wealth, or honour; they differ, however, from one another- and often even the same man identifies it with different things, with health when he is ill, with wealth when he is poor; but, conscious of their ignorance, they admire those who proclaim some great ideal that is above their comprehension. Now some thought that apart from these many goods there is another which is self-subsistent and causes the goodness of all these as well. To examine all the opinions that have been held were perhaps somewhat fruitless; enough to examine those that are most prevalent or that seem to be arguable.

>To judge from the lives that men lead, the majority of men, and men of the most vulgar type, seem (not without some ground) to identify the good, or happiness, with pleasure; which is the reason why they love the life of enjoyment. For there are, we may say, three prominent types of life- that just mentioned, the political, and thirdly the contemplative life. Now the mass of mankind are evidently quite slavish in their tastes, preferring a life suitable to beasts, but they get some ground for their view from the fact that many of those in high places share the tastes of Sardanapallus. A consideration of the prominent types of life shows that people of superior refinement and of active disposition identify happiness with honour; for this is, roughly speaking, the end of the political life. But it seems too superficial to be what we are looking for, since it is thought to depend on those who bestow honour rather than on him who receives it, but the good we divine to be something proper to a man and not easily taken from him. Further, men seem to pursue honour in order that they may be assured of their goodness; at least it is by men of practical wisdom that they seek to be honoured, and among those who know them, and on the ground of their virtue; clearly, then, according to them, at any rate, virtue is better. And perhaps one might even suppose this to be, rather than honour, the end of the political life. But even this appears somewhat incomplete; for possession of virtue seems actually compatible with being asleep, or with lifelong inactivity, and, further, with the greatest sufferings and misfortunes; but a man who was living so no one would call happy, unless he were maintaining a thesis at all costs. But enough of this; for the subject has been sufficiently treated even in the current discussions. Third comes the contemplative life, which we shall consider later. 

>The life of money-making is one undertaken under compulsion, and wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else. And so one might rather take the aforenamed objects to be ends; for they are loved for themselves. But it is evident that not even these are ends; yet many arguments have been thrown away in support of them. Let us leave this subject, then. 

>...So the argument has by a different course reached the same point; but we must try to state this even more clearly. Since there are evidently more than one end, and we choose some of these (e.g. wealth, flutes, and in general instruments) for the sake of something else, clearly not all ends are final ends; but the chief good is evidently something final. Therefore, if there is only one final end, this will be what we are seeking, and if there are more than one, the most final of these will be what we are seeking. Now we call that which is in itself worthy of pursuit more final than that which is worthy of pursuit for the sake of something else, and that which is never desirable for the sake of something else more final than the things that are desirable both in themselves and for the sake of that other thing, and therefore we call final without qualification that which is always desirable in itself and never for the sake of something else...

> Now such a thing happiness, above all else, is held to be; for this we choose always for self and never for the sake of something else, but honour, pleasure, reason, and every virtue we choose indeed for themselves (for if nothing resulted from them we should still choose each of them), but we choose them also for the sake of happiness, judging that by means of them we shall be happy. Happiness, on the other hand, no one chooses for the sake of these, nor, in general, for anything other than itself. 

> From the point of view of self-sufficiency the same result seems to follow; for the final good is thought to be self-sufficient…. the self-sufficient we now define as that which when isolated makes life desirable and lacking in nothing; and such we think happiness to be; and further we think it most desirable of all things, without being counted as one good thing among others- if it were so counted it would clearly be made more desirable by the addition of even the least of goods; for that which is added becomes an excess of goods, and of goods the greater is always more desirable. Happiness, then, is something final and self-sufficient, and is the end of action. 

> Presumably, however, to say that happiness is the chief good seems a platitude, and a clearer account of what it is still desired. This might perhaps be given, if we could first ascertain the function of man. For just as for a flute-player, a sculptor, or an artist, and, in general, for all things that have a function or activity, the good and the 'well' is thought to reside in the function, so would it seem to be for man, if he has a function. Have the carpenter, then, and the tanner certain functions or activities, and has man none? Is he born without a function? Or as eye, hand, foot, and in general each of the parts evidently has a function,may one lay it down that man similarly has a function apart from all these? What then can this be? Life seems to be common even to plants, but we are seeking what is peculiar to man. Let us exclude, therefore, the life of nutrition and growth. Next there would be a life of perception, but it also seems to be common even to the horse, the ox, and every animal. There remains, then, an active life of the element that has a rational principle; of this, one part has such a principle in the sense of being obedient to one, the other in the sense of possessing one and exercising thought. And, as 'life of the rational element' also has two meanings, we must state that life in the sense of activity is what we mean; for this seems to be the more proper sense of the term. Now if the function of man is an activity of soul which follows or implies a rational principle, and if we say 'so-and-so-and 'a good so-and-so' have a function which is the same in kind, e.g. a lyre, and a good lyre-player, and so without qualification in all cases, eminence in respect of goodness being added to the name of the function (for the function of a lyre-player is to play the lyre, and that of a good lyre-player is to do so well): if this is the case, and we state the function of man to be a certain kind of life, and this to be an activity or actions of the soul implying a rational principle, and the function of a good man to be the good and noble performance of these, and if any action is well performed when it is performed in accordance with the appropriate excellence: if this is the case, human good turns out to be activity of soul in accordance with virtue, and if there are more than one virtue, in accordance with the best and most complete. 

> But we must add 'in a complete life.' For one swallow does not make a summer, nor does one day; and so too one day, or a short time, does not make a man blessed and happy. 

>Let this serve as an outline of the good; for we must presumably first sketch it roughly, and then later fill in the details. But it would seem that any one is capable of carrying on and articulating what has once been well outlined, and that time is a good discoverer or partner in such a work; to which facts the advances of the arts are due; for any one can add what is lacking. And we must also remember what has been said before, and not look for precision in all things alike, but in each class of things such precision as accords with the subject-matter, and so much as is appropriate to the inquiry. For a carpenter and a geometer investigate the right angle in different ways; the former does so in so far as the right angle is useful for his work, while the latter inquires what it is or what sort of thing it is; for he is a spectator of the truth. We must act in the same way, then, in all other matters as well, that our main task may not be subordinated to minor questions. Nor must we demand the cause in all matters alike; it is enough in some cases that the fact be well established, as in the case of the first principles; the fact is the primary thing or first principle. Now of first principles we see some by induction, some by perception, some by a certain habituation, and others too in other ways. But each set of principles we must try to investigate in the natural way, and we must take pains to state them definitely, since they have a great influence on what follows. For the beginning is thought to be more than half of the whole, and many of the questions we ask are cleared up by it. 

>Since happiness is an activity of soul in accordance with perfect virtue, we must consider the nature of virtue; for perhaps we shall thus see better the nature of happiness...

>Virtue too is distinguished into kinds in accordance with this difference; for we say that some of the virtues are intellectual and others moral, philosophic wisdom and understanding and practical wisdom beingintellectual, liberality and temperance moral. For in speaking about a man's character we do not say that he is wise or has understanding but that he is good-tempered or temperate; yet we praise the wise man also with respect to his state of mind; and of states of mind we call those which merit praise virtues.

### 1. Virtue ethics originated with Aristotle.

That is it originated (in the west) with Aristotle, Plato, Socrates and other Greeks, and (in the east) to Confucious and others.

### 2. The highest good is happiness. 

Not pleasure, honor, or wealth. These are not "self-sufficient". We want them for the sake of something else.

We want happiness *for its own sake*.

### 3. Happiness is "an activity of soul in accordance with perfect virtue." 

In other words, virtue ethics says that the good life, happiness, well-being, is only possible for the virtuous and wise person.

### 4. There are moral and intellectual virtues. 

Aristotle says: "Virtues" are good habits of feeling, action, and thought." The goal is ‘to feel [desires and emotions] at the right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right people, with the right motive, and in the right way’. 

Moral virtues concern intermediate between excess and deficiency, intellectual virtues assist you in judging true and false.

### 5. There are individual virtues (such as moderation) and social virtues (such as justice).

Some virtues have to do with how I comport myself even when no one is looking. On a desert island, I could be virtuous or vice-ridden. 

Other virtues have to do with how I comport myself in society. I can't be unjust to others if no others are around. I owe respect to my elders, but can't if I am the eldest. I owe care to my children, but can't if I don't have children.

### 6. Ethics is not just about actions but about the whole of life. 

Dilemmas are important. 

But dilemmas are not *as important* as daily life. Daily life is about setting priorities, pursuing them, and thinking long-term. 

The primary question is: "how should I love?" What kind of life should I live? 

For example, what major goods should I pursue? What career should I choose? Marriage or no? Kids or no? Where should I live?

### 7. Applying virtues takes practical wisdom. 

1. A general conception of what is good or bad (conditions for human flourishing);
2. The ability to perceive, in light of that general conception, what is required in terms of feeling, choice, and action in a particular situation; the ability to deliberate well; and the ability to act on that deliberation. 

There are few safe generalizations about right and wrong. 
But ethics is not subjective; it is ‘context-sensitive’. 

Practical wisdom is a form of intuitive reason. It is a "know how" rather than a "know that". 

Practical wisdom cannot be taught, but must be acquired through experience. Like piano playing, tennis, or making conversation.

### 8. The "function" of humanity has to do with our rationality. 

What is it that humans do but no other creature does? 

- Not life -- plants are alive, reproduce, grow, etc.
- Not consciousness -- animals are conscious

### 9.  Friendship is a virtue.

Friendship is not just a relationship but an activity -- the activity of being a good friend, benefiting your friends, etc. It requires reciprical respect but also actual benefits. Hence, one can be in or out of the habit of friendship.

### 10. Objections: Not everyone can know what is right; not practical; virtues can conflict; objective goodness of "living well"?

- Not everyone can know what is right. Supposing that you are born with a lower IQ or without access to education, can you not become virtuous and not happy? Response:
- Not practical. Virtues are broad, not specific. "Be virtuous" doesn't seem as useful as "don't ever lie." Response:
- Virtues can conflict. What about the conflict between honesty and kindness?
