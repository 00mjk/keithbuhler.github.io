### 1. Virtue ethics originated with Aristotle.

That is it originated (in the west) with Aristotle, Plato, Socrates and other Greeks, and (in the east) to Confucious and others.

### 2. The highest good is happiness. 

Not pleasure, honor, or wealth. These are not "self-sufficient". We want them for the sake of something else.

We want happiness *for its own sake*.

### 3. Happiness is "an activity of soul in accordance with perfect virtue." 

In other words, virtue ethics says that the good life, happiness, well-being, is only possible for the virtuous and wise person.

### 4. There are moral and intellectual virtues. 

Aristotle says: "Virtues" are good habits of feeling, action, and thought." The goal is ‘to feel [desires and emotions] at the right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right people, with the right motive, and in the right way’. 

Moral virtues concern intermediate between excess and deficiency, intellectual virtues assist you in judging true and false.

### 5. There are individual virtues (such as moderation) and social virtues (such as justice).

Some virtues have to do with how I comport myself even when no one is looking. On a desert island, I could be virtuous or vice-ridden. 

Other virtues have to do with how I comport myself in society. I can't be unjust to others if no others are around. I owe respect to my elders, but can't if I am the eldest. I owe care to my children, but can't if I don't have children.

### 6. Ethics is not just about actions but about the whole of life. 

Dilemmas are important. 

But dilemmas are not *as important* as daily life. Daily life is about setting priorities, pursuing them, and thinking long-term. 

The primary question is: "how should I love?" What kind of life should I live? 

For example, what major goods should I pursue? What career should I choose? Marriage or no? Kids or no? Where should I live?

### 7. Applying virtues takes practical wisdom. 

1. A general conception of what is good or bad (conditions for human flourishing);
2. The ability to perceive, in light of that general conception, what is required in terms of feeling, choice, and action in a particular situation; the ability to deliberate well; and the ability to act on that deliberation. 

There are few safe generalizations about right and wrong. 
But ethics is not subjective; it is ‘context-sensitive’. 

Practical wisdom is a form of intuitive reason. It is a "know how" rather than a "know that". 

Practical wisdom cannot be taught, but must be acquired through experience. Like piano playing, tennis, or making conversation.

### 8. The 'function' of humanity has to do with our rationality. 

What is it that humans do but no other creature does? 

- Not life -- plants are alive, reproduce, grow, etc.
- Not consciousness -- animals are conscious
- Rational choice -- only humans make rational choices on the basis of reflection. We judge what is true or false, good or bad, and act accordingly. 

- Put differently, you can't know what to do if you don't know (a) the facts and (b) what is worthwhile. Should I move to Canada or stay in the U.S.? I can only answer that if I know what each place is like, and how well each place would fit my goals and allow me to acquire more virtue.

### 9.  Friendship is a virtue.

Friendship is not just a relationship but an activity -- the activity of being a good friend, benefiting your friends, etc. It requires reciprical respect but also actual benefits. Hence, one can be in or out of the habit of friendship.

### 10. Objections: Not everyone can know what is right; not practical; virtues can conflict; objective goodness of "living well"?

- Not everyone can know what is right. Supposing that you are born with a lower IQ or without access to education, can you not become virtuous and not happy? Response:
- Not practical. Virtues are broad, not specific. "Be virtuous" doesn't seem as useful as "don't ever lie." Response:
- Virtues can conflict. What about the conflict between honesty and kindness?
