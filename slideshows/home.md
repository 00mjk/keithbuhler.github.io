# Keith and Lindsay left California in July of 2012.


<section></section>

## They had two beautiful children and worked hard to complete graduate school. 


<section></section>




## In November 2016, Keith defended his dissertation.


<section></section>

## We immediately began applying for jobs.


<section></section>


## We hoped to return to Cali.


<section></section>

## We longed to be closer to family and friends there.


<section></section>




# We prayed a lot.


<section></section>




# We thought it just wouldn’t work to come back.


<section></section>




# Then, in a few short weeks our prayers were answered.


<section></section>





# We are moving back in Cali this June.


<section></section>


# We are grateful to God for providing.


<section></section>


# We are so grateful for our community here in Kentucky who have become family to us.

## We will miss you all.


<section></section>



### And to family we have missed so much….

# WE ARE COMING HOME!
