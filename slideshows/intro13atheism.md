- Natural selection
- The anthropic principle
- Luck




### Dawkins Life

- Born 1941
- Grew up Anglican (Christian) but lost his faith in his teens.
- Successful career in biology and ethology
- _Selfish Gene_ popularized ‘gene-centered’ view of evolution (rather than macro traits)
- Turned to modern polemicist against “religion”
- _Blind Watchmaker_ (1986) argues against appearance of intelligent design

### Style

- Dawkins is a polemecist
- Dawkins is a popularizer
- Writes about science but writes _as_ a poet

> There's real poetry in the real world. Science is the poetry of reality

### Christian apologists argue

1. There is almost certainly a God, therefore
2. Religion (and especially Chrisitanity) is the source of great human happiness and many goods for culture, civilization, hospitals, charity, and happiness
3. Atheism is immoral, hyper-intellectual, imbalanced, despairing, and intellectually unfulfilling. 


### God Delusion argues

1. There is almost certainly no god, therefore...
2. Monotheistic religion is a cause of evil, suffering, ignorance, stupidity, and war.
3. Atheism on the other hand, can be moral, balanced, happy, and intellectually fulfilled. 


### The Core Argument

1. If we can explain 'design' without god, then there is no good reason to suppose a god exists.
2. We can explain 'design' without god (via natural selection, chance, and the anthropic principle).
3. Therefore, there is no good reason to suppose a god exists.


### The Argument: Part I, Against Theism

1. There is little reason to believe in God except the appearance of design.
2. One of the greatest challenges to the human intellect has been to explain how the complex, improbable appearance of design in the universe arises.
3. The natural temptation is to attribute the appearance of design to actual design itself.
4. The temptation is a false one because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer.

### 
5. The most ingenious and powerful explanation is Darwinian evolution by natural selection.
6. Though we don’t have an equivalent explanation for physics, we should not give up the hope of a better explanation arising in physics, something as powerful as Darwinism is for biology.
8. Therefore, the complex, improbable appearance of design can probably be explained  eventually.
9. Therefore, there is no need of God to explain design.
10. Therefore, there is probably no God.
