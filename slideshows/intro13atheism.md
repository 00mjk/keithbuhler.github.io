### Style

- Dawkins is a polemecist
- Dawkins is a popularizer
- Writes about science but writes _as_ a poet

> There's real poetry in the real world. Science is the poetry of reality

### God Delusion
Seeks to show that: 
There is almost certainly no god, therefore...
Monotheistic religion is a cause of evil. 
Atheism on the other hand, can be moral, balanced, happy, and intellectually fulfilled.
