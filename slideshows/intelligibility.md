## Intelligibility 

### What is both real and invisible?

</section> <!--Intro slide end-->

## The problem 

- The immediate, obvious, and undeniable is physical
- Knowledge about the immediate or obvious (common sense) is easiest
- Knowledge about the physical (the sciences) is also easier
- So why think anything non-physical or non-immediate exists? 
- And if it does it exist, how can we know anything certain about it? 

Call "naturalism" the claim that all that exists and can be known is physical. The problem is that naturalism seems plausible.

### The solution

- Part one, the logical solution: physicalism is self-refuting.
- Part two, the practical solutions: give examples!

</section><section data-markdown> 

### The logical solution

- The argument for physicalism is not itself physical. It is not obvious, scientific, etc. It is an extremely rarified and abstract form of intellectual argument that only some westernized intellectuals can even comprehend let alone agree on.

### The practical solution

Here are some examples of things that are "intelligible."


- numbers
- properties, relations
- relations
- God, human beings
- angels, demons
- the past
- the future
- possibilities
- moral laws
- logic itself

Let's look at each one more closely.
