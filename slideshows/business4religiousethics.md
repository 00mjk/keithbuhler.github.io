## Intro

## Religion and public morality

So how does this affect business? 

Some businesses are composed of mostly religious people; some are composed of mostly secular people. 

Some businesses take a public stand on religion. Others don't.

But when it comes to their ethics, most people take some cues from their religion. 

How does religion affect morality? 

One major answer is: divine command theory

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Divine command theory

- Divine Command Theory is the view that morality in some way depends on God or the divine. 
- “(i) God in some sense determines what is moral; 
- (ii) moral obligations are derived from God’s commands, where these commands are understood as statements of the revealed divine will.”

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Divine command theory
- The straightforward version of Divine Command Theory is the Judeo-Christian version where God tells his people how to live and what not to do. 
- That is not the only version, however. 
- It might be that we know how to live and what not to do even without divine commands; 
- It might be that god gives commands for other reasons than knowledge, such as encouragement. 

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Divine command theory

* Michael Austin: “Divine Command Theory has been and continues to be highly controversial. It has been criticized by numerous philosophers, including Plato, Kai Nielsen, and J. L. Mackie. 
* The theory also has many defenders, both classic and contemporary, such as Thomas Aquinas, Robert Adams, and Philip Quinn. 
* The question of the possible connections between religion and ethics is of interest to moral philosophers as well as philosophers of religion, but it also leads us to consider the role of religion in society as well as the nature of moral deliberation. Given this, the arguments offered for and against Divine Command Theory have both theoretical and practical importance.”

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Divine command theory - Possible advantages 

1. Immanuel Kant argues that "we must believe that God exists because the requirements of morality are too much for us to bear. We must believe that there is a God who will help us satisfy the demands of the moral law. With such a belief, we have the hope that we will be able to live moral lives." (Austin)
2.  That is, if the origin of the universe is a personal moral being, then the existence of objective moral truths are at home, so to speak, in the universe. By contrast, if the origin of the universe is non-moral, then the existence of such truths becomes philosophically perplexing, because it is unclear how moral properties can come into existence via non-moral origins.

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Divine command theory - Possible disadvantages
1. Egoism Problem — The motive for being moral might become merely to avoid punishment or gain bliss. 
2. Euthyphro Dilemma. - Should we love one another because God commands us to do so? Or does God commands us to love one another because that is what we ought to do?

</section> <section data-markdown>

### Euthyphro dilemma

We ought to love one another because God commands us to do so.  
<p class=fragment> 
*But what if he commands something immoral? Moral truths seem to be necessary truths.*
</p>
<p class=fragment> 
God commands us to love one another because that is what we ought to do. </p>
<p class=fragment> 
*But then moral goodness is independent of God, and he is subject to it.*
</p>

### Goodness without god

What are secular/humanist alternatives? 

- “Fundamentalists correctly perceive that universal moral standards are required for the proper functioning of society. But they erroneously believe that God is the only possible source of such standards. 
- Philosophers as diverse as Plato, Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, George Edward Moore, and John Rawls have demonstrated that it is possible to have a universal morality without God. 
- Contrary to what the fundamentalists would have us believe, then, what our society really needs is not more religion but a richer notion of the nature of morality.”[^1]

### Goodness without god


1. Cultural relativism — to each his own. 
2. Amoralism — do what works. 
3. Vitalism — whatever is beautiful and lively is good (Dorian Gray)
4. Scientific ethics — do what is objectively good for people.
5. Natural law — ethics grounded in the laws human nature.

### Goodness without god

<p class=fragment> 
1. Cultural relativism — to each his own. 
- Objection: Cannot criticize other immoral cultures. </p>

<p class=fragment> 
2. Amoralism — do what works. 
      - Objection: Counterintuitive; we know we should not do what works if it’s wrong.</p>

<p class=fragment> 
3. Vitalism — do whatever is beautiful and lively and exciting  (Dorian Gray)
      - Objection:  Simply immoral. </p>
<p class=fragment> 
4. Scientific ethics — do what is objectively good for people.
      - Objection: How to resolve disagreements about the nature of science? 
      - Objection: “Flourishing” — what is it? Humility or pride? </p></section>

<section data-markdown></section>

### Natural law, a compromise

7. Natural law — ethics grounded in the laws human nature.
      - Objection: Identify basic goods: life, friendship, knowledge, freedom.
      - Objection: Identify basic moral duties and prohibitions: do good, avoid evil, harm no one. 
     -  Negotiate less basic goods: how much freedom? Etc.

## Business and Religion: Summary

1. Most people are religious.
2. Almost everybody has a moral sense, whether they are religious or not. 
3. Almost everybody is morally decent most of the time.
3. Businesses must be ethical businesses. 
4. How are they ethical? Does God figure in or not? 
5. If so, then what is the role of divine commands in public life?
6. If not, then how does the natural law apply to business?

Next week, we’ll discuss Utilitarianism, the theory that pleasure is the only good and needs to be maximized.
