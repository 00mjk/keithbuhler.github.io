### Intro

The standard model involves:
- individual
- corporation
- and society as a whole. 

>Individuals must "balance values... with the good of others"; corporations must balance "obligations and economic objectives." And society must understand "patterns of cultural, political, and economic forces" that drive companies in the context of global capitalism. (126)

### A Tripartite Model. 

- Most theorists have two categories: stakeholders and shareholders. 
- On one view, the corporation has a responsibility to shareholders but not stakeholders. 
- On another theory, corporations have a responsibility to both shareholders and stakeholders.  
- Goodpastor is saying stakeholder theory is better than shareholder but not the best.

### The "moral point of view" 

- A common refrain is the need to "Progress" past shareholder to stakeholders
- Progress is a vague term. Progress toward what? 
- We can't *leave behind* shareholders in service of stakeholders. 
- There is an analogy to individual conscience: I must take care of myself and be aware of you

### The "moral point of view" 

- The means a "realization of one's neighbor". So I pursue my own ends and my own good with one's neighbor's good in mind. The question is how? (133)
-  Milton Friedman argued that "The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits."
-  In other words, two people might disagree about how to benefit their stakeholders but agree that their stakeholders should be benefited.

### The "moral point of view" 
-  Can you do *well* by doing *good*? Can you do well (succeed financially) by doing good (morally)?
-  Executive: 

>"I operate in a hyper competitive global marketplace. My primary responsibility is to be profitable in order to serve my shareholders. If I do things that "make my company to be less competitive than my rivals and hence less profitable, am I doing the right thing?"

### The "stakeholder paradox"  

- It seems essential to guide corporate decisions by ethical values beyond stockholder considerations
- It seems illegitimate to do so. 
- Ethics seems supposed to forbid and to demand a partial mindset. (134) 
- Perhaps there are two different kinds of duties: fiduciary duty (to shareholders) to make money and non-fiduciary duties (to stakeholders) to benefit them.

### Human Dignity and Just Community

- The comprehensive view takes into account one's neighbor and society as a whole
