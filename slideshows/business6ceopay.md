## Corporate Responsibility

</section><section data-markdown>
### Intro

The standard model involves:
- individual
- corporation
- and society as a whole. 

>Individuals must "balance values... with the good of others"; corporations must balance "obligations and economic objectives." And society must understand "patterns of cultural, political, and economic forces" that drive companies in the context of global capitalism. (126)

### A Tripartite Model. 

- Most theorists have two categories: stakeholders and shareholders. 
- On one view, the corporation has a responsibility to shareholders but not stakeholders. 
- On another theory, corporations have a responsibility to both shareholders and stakeholders.  
- Goodpastor is saying stakeholder theory is better than shareholder but not the best.

### The "moral point of view" 

- A common refrain is the need to "Progress" past shareholder to stakeholders
- Progress is a vague term. Progress toward what? 
- We can't *leave behind* shareholders in service of stakeholders. 
- There is an analogy to individual conscience: I must take care of myself and be aware of you

### The "moral point of view" 

- The means a "realization of one's neighbor". So I pursue my own ends and my own good with one's neighbor's good in mind. The question is how? (133)
-  Milton Friedman argued that "The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits."
-  In other words, two people might disagree about how to benefit their stakeholders but agree that their stakeholders should be benefited.

### The "moral point of view" 
-  Can you do *well* by doing *good*? Can you do well (succeed financially) by doing good (morally)?
-  Executive: 

>"I operate in a hyper competitive global marketplace. My primary responsibility is to be profitable in order to serve my shareholders. If I do things that "make my company to be less competitive than my rivals and hence less profitable, am I doing the right thing?"

### The "stakeholder paradox"  

- It seems essential to guide corporate decisions by ethical values beyond stockholder considerations
- It seems illegitimate to do so. 
- Ethics seems supposed to forbid and to demand a partial mindset. (134) 
- Perhaps there are two different kinds of duties: fiduciary duty (to shareholders) to make money and non-fiduciary duties (to stakeholders) to benefit them.

## Executive Compensation: Just or Unjust? 

*By John Boatright*

</section><section data-markdown>
### Unfair or Unjust?

![cartoon](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-48W_vqTc_n4/UVNVe-gI0TI/AAAAAAAAQLc/FUrF8u2JeIg/s1600/CEO+pay.jpg)

- Critics are convinced that *something* is wrong with high CEO pay
- But "seldom articulate the grounds"

### Unfair or Unjust?





</section><section data-markdown>
### Boatright's Thesis

1. Is high CEO pay justifiable within a capitalist, free-market framework? 
2. Yes. "The principles of compensation in a free market capitalist system are easily identified and widely accepted." (162)

</section><section data-markdown>
### Arguments
- "The conditions are that the bargaining between a CEO and shareholders not involve fraud or a breach of fiduciary duty." 
- "If these conditions are met, then the agreements made by arm's length bargaining are not morally objectionable."
- "The market for CEOs may be imperfect in ways that are not morally objectionable but are possibly socially undesirable."
- "The current high level of executive pay is due to significant changes in the world economy in the past few decades."
- "Once these changes are understood, then high... CEO pay can be shown to be justified by widely accepted normative principles."
- "The driver of high executive compensation is the power that shareholders have in corporate governance." (163)
- "Ultimately, the debate over executive compensation becomes a question of the justification of shareholder-centered system of corporate governance."

</section><section data-markdown>
### Objections (170)

- Simply too big
- No correlation of pay to performance
- Ratio of lowest paid to highest paid
- Who enforces ratio?
- Unjust increases in pay
- Not the right incentive for CEOs to work hard
- Too much incentive for CEOs to work hard
- Determining pay is not arms-length transaction
- Happenstance determines pay


</section><section data-markdown>
### Justifying (172)

P1. Each person has a right to whatever he gains by exchanging his property through voluntary transactions. 
P2. Each person has a right to the full value of whatever he produces.

### History (163)

- Structure of CEO Pay: salary, bonuses, stocks and options, and incentives + golden handshakes and golden parachutes. 
- LTIP (long term incentive plans) incentive minimal performance threshold 
- The largest increase is the increase in stock values since 1993
- In 1993, average S&P 500 CEO pay was $4 mil, rose to $17 mil by 2000. 
- Pre-1963, CEOs were paid as managers not entrepreneurs.
