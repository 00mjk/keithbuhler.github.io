# Logic

### Judgment

- The act of the mind "judgment" is simply affirming or denying something (not necessarily "judging" i.e., evaluating or criticizing)
- The result, in thought, is a *proposition*. 
- The result, in language, is a *sentence*.


</section><section data-markdown>

### Truth

- Propositions are either true or false 
- Some propositions are unknown ("Trump is a two-term president")
- Some propositions are meaningless ("'Twas brillig in the slithy toves")
- Some propositions are paradoxical ("This statement is a lie")
- But 99% are either true or false... the hard part is figuring out which is which!

### For example

- "Trump won the election with Russia's help"
- "Chickens are dinosaurs"

### Objective & subjective

- Object / subject
- It / who
- That / me
- World / self
- Truth claim / reaction

</section><section data-markdown>

### Subject & Predicate

- The proposition is composed of two concepts: subject and predicate
- The subject is what we are talking about
- The predicate is anything we are affirming or denying about the subject

</section><section data-markdown>


### Subject & Predicate

- Example: God is love. (God=subject, love=predicate)
- Example: "The Grand Canyon is the biggest, coolest hole in the ground in the cosmos."
- Grand Canyon=Subject, the biggest, coolest hole in the ground in the cosmos=predicate
- "God is love" is not the same as "Love is God"
- "God is love" is *about* God (that he is a certain way); "Love is God" is about love (that it is divine).

### Kinds of Proposition

1. Categorical propositions ("apples are juicy" is about the *category* 'apple')
2. Compound propositions: hypothetical, disjunctive, or conjunctive

</section><section data-markdown>

### Compound Propositions

1. Hypothetical: If P, then Q. "If apples are fruits, then they are not vegetables."
2. Disjunctive: P or Q. "Either apples are fruits or apples are vegetables."
3. Conjunctive: P and Q. "Apples are fruits and tomatoes are vegetables."

### Propositions and other speech acts

1. A part of speech is either a proposition or something else.
2. Propositions are simple or compound -- and that's it!
3. Everything else we do with language is not a proposition but something else: questions, exclamations, commands, etc: "Here's Jonny!", "Where's the beef?", "That back flip though!", "Get to your work!", "Ugh!" "Yay!"

</section><section data-markdown>


### Simple Propositions

1. Universal affirmative (A)
2. Universal negative (E)
3. Particular affirmative (I)
4. Particular negative (O)


**A**F **I** RMO  -- I AFFIRM
N **E** G **O** -- I NEGATE
