# Logic

</section> <!--Intro slide end-->
<section data-markdown> 


### Judgment

- The act of the mind "judgment" is simply affirming or denying something (not necessarily "judging" i.e., evaluating or criticizing)
- The result, in thought, is a *proposition*. 
- The result, in language, is a *sentence*.


</section><section data-markdown>

### Truth

- Propositions are either true or false 
- Some propositions are unknown ("Trump is a two-term president")
- Some propositions are meaningless ("'Twas brillig in the slithy toves")
- Some propositions are paradoxical ("This statement is a lie")
- But 99% are either true or false... the hard part is figuring out which is which!

### For example
- "Trump won the election with Russia's help"
- "Chickens are dinosaurs" 



</section><section data-markdown>


### Objective & subjective

- Object / subject
- It / who
- That / me
- World / self
- Truth claim / reaction

</section><section data-markdown>

### Subject & Predicate

- The proposition is composed of two concepts: subject and predicate
- The subject is what we are talking about
- The predicate is anything we are affirming or denying about the subject

</section><section data-markdown>


### Subject & Predicate

- Example: God is love. (God=subject, love=predicate)
- Example: "The Grand Canyon is the biggest, coolest hole in the ground in the cosmos."
- Grand Canyon=Subject, the biggest, coolest hole in the ground in the cosmos=predicate
- "God is love" is not the same as "Love is God"
- "God is love" is *about* God (that he is a certain way); "Love is God" is about love (that it is divine).

### Kinds of Proposition

1. Categorical propositions ("apples are juicy" is about the *category* 'apple')
2. Compound propositions: hypothetical, disjunctive, or conjunctive

</section><section data-markdown>

### Compound Propositions

1. Hypothetical: If P, then Q. "If apples are fruits, then they are not vegetables."
2. Disjunctive: P or Q. "Either apples are fruits or apples are vegetables."
3. Conjunctive: P and Q. "Apples are fruits and tomatoes are vegetables."

</section><section data-markdown>


### Propositions and other speech acts

1. A part of speech is either a proposition or something else.
2. Propositions are simple or compound -- and that's it!
3. Everything else we do with language is not a proposition but something else: questions, exclamations, commands, etc: "Here's Jonny!", "Where's the beef?", "That back flip though!", "Get to your work!", "Ugh!" "Yay!"

</section><section data-markdown>


### Truth

- Truth is in propositions
- Truth is not in terms (except by clarity)
- Truth is not in arguments (except by the conclusion being true, which is a proposition, or the premises, which are propositions)
- Logical truth is correspondance of thought to reality
- Substantive truth is in God's mind, the world, reality
- "Truth", faithfulness, 'emeth' is in people 


</section><section data-markdown>


### Simple Propositions

1. Universal affirmative (A)
2. Universal negative (E)
3. Particular affirmative (I)
4. Particular negative (O)


***A*** F ***I*** RMO  -- I AFFIRM

N ***E*** G ***O*** -- I NEGATE


</section><section data-markdown>


### Quantifiers: "All", "some" or "none"

- A: All S are P 
- I: Some S are P
- E: No S are P (All S are *not* P)
- O: Some S are not P

</section><section data-markdown>

### Tricky "O" 

- Tricky: "Not all lawyers are crooks"
- As in, no lawyers are actually crooks, or *some* are not crooks (but some are)?
- Very trickY: "All lawyers are not crooks" (as in none are, or not all?)


</section><section data-markdown>

### Examples

- Turn to 156-7
- Not a proposition?
- Simple proposition?
- Compound proposition?
- If simple, put in strict form

# Jesus and Logic

</section><section data-markdown>
### Reasoning

- 'Man is a rational animal.'
- 'Man' is gender inclusive, and concrete -- more inclusive than the sexist abstraction of 'humanity' which excludes almost all English speakers
-  'Rational' means reasoning, wisdom, intuition, understanding, apprehension, etc. 
-  Human reasoning begins with experience
-  Human reasoning knows particulars and universals 
- Syllogism: "3 proposition argument)"

</section><section data-markdown>
### Foundations of Syllogism (187-8)

1. Whatever is universally true of a subject must be true of everything contained in that subject
2. Whatever is universally false of a subject must be false of everything contained in that subject
3. Two things identical with on and the same third thing are identical with each other
4. Two things which are not identical with a third thing are not identical with each other 



</section><section data-markdown>
### Tautologies

- Necessarily true
- Self-evident
- "Frogs are frogs"
- "If the ball is round and red, then the ball is round"
- No new information: "This candidate will be elected if there is sufficient voter turnout"; "X will be elected if X is elected"
-  "The team who can turn it around in the second half and convert possessions to touchdowns is going to walk away the winner" (The winner will win; the highest scorer will score the highest)





</section><section data-markdown>
### Detecting arguments

- Detect its presence (is there an argument here?)
- Detect its conclusion 
- Detect its validity 



</section><section data-markdown>
### Conclusion indicators (192)

- consequently
- therefore
- so
- implies that
- so you can see that
- which demonstrates
- as a result
- for this reason


</section><section data-markdown>
### Premise indicators 

- because
- since
- for
- if we assume that
- follows from
- the reason that




</section><section data-markdown>
### Explanations

- He has shifty eyes (fact) because he is guilty (explanation)
- He is absent (fact) because he is ill (explanation)

- Is he guilty? Maybe. Not all shifty-eyed people are guilty.
- Is he absent? Yes! Because he's ill? Maybe. 




</section><section data-markdown>
### Validity

- 'Valid' means that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.
- Again: validity means that *if* the premises are true *then the conclusion must be true*
- Again: validity means that if the premises are true *it is impossible for the conclusion to be false*




</section><section data-markdown>
### Validity Table

| Premises T/F                |     Argument Valid                |    Argument  Invalid        |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|     T                       |     **Conclusion True**           | Conclusion unknown          |
|    F                        |     Conclusion unknown            | Conclusion unknown          |





</section><section data-markdown>
### False premises

- If the argument is valid and the conclusion is *false*, then at least one premise must be false. 
- All evil spirits are birds. All evil sparrows are evil spirits. Therefore all sparrows are birds. (True conclusion, valid argument...)
- The earth is a star. No stars are fish. The earth is not a fish. 



</section><section data-markdown>
### Invalid arguments

- If an argument is invalid, the conclusion still may be true! 
- If an argument is invalid, all the premises may still be true! 
- If an argument is valid, all the premises and conclusion may still be false!

- All dinosaurs are dead. Some presidents are dead. So some people are presidents. (True conclusion, invalid)
- All pigs are purple. Purple things are immortal. Pigs are immortal. (Valid but all false)
- The sky is blue. The grass is green. Therefore man is mortal. (All true, but invalid)


</section><section data-markdown>
### Exercises (199)

- The dullest exercises in the book!




</section><section data-markdown>
### Willard, “Jesus the Logician”

- Being disciples of Jesus includes submitting to him intellectually 
- The words "Jesus" and "Logician" feel disconnected
- Yet to be his disciple, as scholars, requires thinking about him qua logician



</section><section data-markdown>
### Theory and practice

- Jesus did not develop logical theory, like Aristotle or Frege
- But most thinkers don't do that
- And thinkers who develop logical systems may or may not be more logical
- Jesus did *use* logic

</section><section data-markdown>
### The Will to Be Logical

>To be logical no doubt does require an understanding of what implication and contradiction are, as well as the ability to recognize their presence or absence in obvious cases. But it also requires the will to be logical, and then certain personal qualities that make it possible and actual...

- Using logic requires intelligence (noticing implications and contradictions)
- Using logic requires moral character (hypocrites, liars, thieves, murderers must avoid logic)

</section><section data-markdown>
### Enthymeme

- "His use of logic is always enthymemic" (2)
- Enthymeme is a logical syllogism with one or more "suppressed premises", i.e., unstated
- "If you want to be rich, you have to save." (If you want to be rich, you have to save. **You want to be rich.** **Therefore you have to save.**)
- "Candide is a typical French novel; therefore it is vulgar." (**All typical French novels are vulgar**; Candide is a typical French novel; therefore Candide is vulgar.)

</section><section data-markdown>
### Enforcing the ritual law consistently

1. The disciples were walking through fields, stripping the grain and eating them.
2. The Pharisess accused them of breaking the law because violating ritual norm
3. Jesus points out that "there are conditiosn in which the ritual laws in question do not apply"
4. Jesus "brings up cases of this that the Pharisees already concede" (David, showbread; Priests, sabbath regulations)


</section><section data-markdown>
### Enforcing the ritual law consistently

- Conclusion: 

> It logically follows, then, that one is not automatically guilty of wrongdoing or disobedience when they do not keep the ritual observances as dictated, in case there is some greater need that must be met. This is something the Pharisees have, by implication, already admitted by accepting the rightness in the two cases Jesus referred to.




</section><section data-markdown>
### Enforcing the ritual law consistently

- Deeper issue: God's character and intention
- Human ritual laws: 

>[Those who claim to practice the ritual law] are forced to choose between hypocrisy and open inconsistency, and he does sometimes use the word "hypocrisy" of them (e.g. Luke 13:15), implying that they knew they were being inconsistent and accepted it. In fact, the very idea of hypocrisy implies logical inconsistency. "They say, and do not" what their saying implies. (Matthew 23:2)
