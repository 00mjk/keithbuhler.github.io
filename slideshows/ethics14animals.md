# Animal Rights

- Animals, Right!?
- Orwell, "Shooting an Elephant"


</section><section data-markdown>

## Intro

- 100 animals are killed in labs every minute (for science)
- 8 billion chickens are killed for food in the U.S. alone (for food)
- Do animals have rights? 

## Some distinctions

- killing / torturing (chickens can be killed without suffering)
- torturing for money / torturing for knowledge (civet cats are tormented for profitable product, baboons tortured for scientific research)
- animal rights / human virtues (it might be virtuous to be conscientious with your car, coffee table, and clothes even the object of your care don't have rights)
- early death / natural death (100% of all animals die eventually)

## Shooting an Elephant

- Orwell living in India as a sub-divisional police officer
- He (and the Empire) were hated by the local Burmese, though he agreed with them against the Empire

>"One day something happened which... was enlightening... gave me a better glimpse than I had before of the real nature of imperialism--the real motives for which despotic governments act." (796)



</section><section data-markdown>

- The escaped elephant was destroying property and it killed one local
- Orwell was called
- He asked for an elephant rifle, just as self-protection while he assessed the situation
- The Burmese saw the rifle and hypothesized that he was intending to kill the elephant
- A crowd amassed
- With 2,000 people behind him all expecting him to shoot the elephant, he decided to shoot the elephant
- He did, the locals harvested the meat and tusks, and he received mixed reviews from his fellow Brits

### Motive

>They did not like me, but with the magical rifle in my hands I was momentarily worth watching. And suddenly I realized that I should have to shoot the elephant after all. The people expected it of me and I had got to do it; I could feel their two thousand wills pressing me forward, irresistibly.

### Motive

>And it was at this moment, as I stood there with the rifle in my hands, that I first grasped the hollowness, the futility of the white man's dominion in the East. Here was I, the white man with his gun, standing in front of the unarmed native crowd — seemingly the leading actor of the piece; but in reality I was only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro by the will of those yellow faces behind. I perceived in this moment that when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he destroys.

### Motive

>To come all that way, rifle in hand, with two thousand people marching at my heels, and then to trail feebly away, having done nothing — no, that was impossible. The crowd would laugh at me. And my whole life, every white man's life in the East, was one long struggle not to be laughed at.

### Motive

>And afterwards I was very glad that the coolie had been killed; it put me legally in the right and it gave me a sufficient pretext for shooting the elephant. I often wondered whether any of the others grasped that I had done it solely to avoid looking a fool.

### The Act

>But I did not want to shoot the elephant. I watched him beating his bunch of grass against his knees, with that preoccupied grandmotherly air that elephants have. It seemed to me that it would be murder to shoot him. At that age I was not squeamish about killing animals, but I had never shot an elephant and never wanted to. (Somehow it always seems worse to kill a large animal.)

### Discussion

* Was it wrong to shoot the elephant?
* Is it "murder"?
* Is it worse to kill a large animal? (even for food)
* Is it better to kill rats and mice and frogs? (only for science)
