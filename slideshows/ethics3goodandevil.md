### What is goodness? Three answers: 

- Plato: the good is the ultimate reality, source of goodness, truth, and beauty 
- Manichee: Good and evil are equal and opposite realities
- Hedonism: Good is pleasure, evil is pain and suffering
- Nihilism: Good and evil are not real

</section><section data-markdown>

### Problem with Hedonism

If good is pleasure, evil is pain and suffering, why does some evil seem frightening, irrational, truly despicable? 

</section><section data-markdown>

### Problem with Manicheeism

If good and evil are equal and opposites, why are most things and most people mostly good? The "dark side" is not even close to half. 

And why are all evil things corruptions of goodness?

### A Puzzle about Platonism

If the Good is the ultimate reality, source of goodness, truth, and beauty, what is the Good's relationship to nature? 

What is the Good's relationship to God?

</section><section data-markdown>
### An argument for Platonism

All good things have goodness in common.
Some good things have nothing else in common but goodness. (Compare all red things, all equal numbers). 
Therefore, Goodness is a real abstract property, and irreducible to any other property. 


</section><section data-markdown>
### Platonism

You are a Platonist about goodness if you think 

- (a) goodness is real and 
- (b) it is not reducible to anything in nature, such as pleasure. 

From there, you can affirm religious Platonism (where God is the Good) or non-religious platonism (where the Good is ultimate).

### What is goodness? An abstract property, the transcendent source of reality and truth

### Another distinction: is everything *either* good or bad?

Consider that some things may be *better* than other good things, without the lesser good things being *bad.*

### Nietzsche 

> Where is God gone? he called out. "I mean to tell you! *We have killed him,* -- you and I! We are all his murderers! 
 

 </section><section data-markdown>

>But how have we done it? How were we able to drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the whole horizon? What did we do when we loosened this earth from its sun? Wither do we move?... Do we not stray, as through infinite nothingness?... has it not become colder? Does not night come on continually, darker and darker? ... 

 </section><section data-markdown>

God is dead! God remains dead! And we have killed him! How shall we console ourselves, the most murderous of murderers?

### Billy Budd

</section><section data-markdown>
### Billy Budd

- Claggart is dishonest, envious, malicious, grumpy, and intentionally slanders Billy as a mutineer with an aim to getting him killed.
- Billy is honest, guileless, obedient, cheerful, with a speech impediment, but (intentionally) punches Claggart and (accidentally) kills Claggart. 
- What should be done? 

</section><section data-markdown>
### Legal v. Moral 

>"In the light of that martial code whereby it was formally to be judged, innocence and guilt personified in Claggart and Budd in effect changed places." (55)

> "Clash of military duty with moral scruple... vitalized by compassion." (60)

- The martial law says Budd deserves death, and Claggart is innocent
- The moral law says Claggart deserves death, and Budd is innocent (or guilty of involuntary manslaughter)
