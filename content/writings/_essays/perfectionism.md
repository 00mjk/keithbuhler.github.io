### Can we have complete faith in God despite having sinful bodies? 


Jesus did it; why can’t we? -- see 1 Cor. 11:1. “Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.” Paul imitated Christ, who lived a physical, bodily existence, blood, bones, nerves, tendons, ligaments and all. And we are supposed to imitate Paul. Doesn’t that settle it?  

If that doesn't settle the question for you, let's step back and think more about the question: This question assumes a few things. It assumes that faith is in some sense opposed by sin. This I would agree with. Jesus says, “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” A morally clean heart allows the heart to “see” God more clearly; a dirty heart obstructs vision.

But the question also assumes that my body is sinful. Is this true? Adam and Eve had bodies before they sinned, and their bodies were sinful. Yes, you might say, but the fall caused their bodies to become sinful. After all, they were ashamed of their nakedness, right? 

Yes and no. 

Our bodies are *not* sinful in the sense that the first sin was a sin of the mind and heart, not the body. Eve “desired” the fruit, “saw that it was pleasing to the eyes,” and “desirable to make one wise,” 

>So when the woman saw…  she 	took of its fruit and ate.

Her sin – and Adam’s – was one of disobedience; a disposition of prideful self-confidence. The fact that she used her hand to pluck the fruit and her teeth to bite it are accidental to the sin itself. She could have sinned in disobedience without her hands; in fact, her hands were working in their service of her sinful decision. 

That said, our bodies are sinful in the sense that all bodily existence – not just human bodies, but all bodies – including minerals, galaxies, and trees are negatively affected by the Fall. But they did not fall morally like the human mind fell. There are different kinds of badness. There is sin of people (which is the badness of beings endowed with reason, like men and angels); there is malfunction (which is the badness of machines, like your car or computer); there is disharmony (which is the badness of music or musicians). A bad musician is not someone we throw in jail; it is someone we don’t hire for concerts because they can’t hit the notes.  Similarly, the body is bad in a bodily sense – it breaks down, gets sick, dies. The minerals in the ground are out of harmony with each other in that they sometimes fall on people’s heads when God never intended rocks to cause harm. The galaxies themselves (in an unclear way) are not as in order as they should be, if man had not sinned.

But even if you don’t buy this “non-moral” badness, I would argue that the body is sinful (morally bad) only insofar as people use it for sinful purposes. I (the person) or a fallen angel may stain the body, but it wasn’t bad to begin with just because it is fleshly. 

And even if you still think, the body is inherently morally sinful even if I am not (at the moment) sinning, that still doesn’t prove the point. We still can have complete faith even in these bodies. How do we know this? Because Jesus’ redemption was successful. Christ died on the cross once for all, and redeemed us, body and soul. That means, no matter how bad the sinner, he may be redeemed and brought into the Kingdom of God. No matter how bad the body, it may be redeemed and brought into the Kingdom of God. 

Jesus Redemption either worked, or it didn’t. If it didn’t, then the body is sinful, and all people are still hopelessly sinful, and no one is going to heaven. But if it did work, then we must accept this blaringly obvious implication, that our blood and bones are (or at least can be) redeemed. 

Once we accept this, certain confusing Bible verses become clear: For instance, Paul says in Ephesians:

> For he himself is our peace, who has made [Jews and Gentiles] both one and has broken down the dividing wall of hostility ***in his flesh...***

This implies that, contrary to limiting our faith, Christ’s physical existence is the means by which we are united to each other. 

But that’s Christ’s body, you might say. What about ours? Again, if the redemption is true, then our bodies are or are becoming holy. In fact, some verses imply that we cannot live our Christian life fully without them. Paul says in Romans 12:1:

> I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship...

In this verse, rather than obstructing true worship, our bodies make our worship complete. Just as we used to serve sin “in our members” (our limbs) so now we serve God with our hands and feet. 

But the best argument is also the simplest: Christ, fully human and empowered by the Holy Spirit -- lived in a body with complete faith -- Why can’t you?
