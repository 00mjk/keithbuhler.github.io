### Required Books: 
- Athanaze

### Handouts (provided)
- Plato
- Tricky words and phrases
- Declensions




### Course Description:
The aim of this course is to enable you to begin reading, understanding, and translating Ancient Greek. 

Following the "Athenaze" text and workbook, we will cover the fundamentals of the ancient Greek language, including the alphabet, pronunciation, grammar, and a working vocabulary of about 500+ common words. The Athanaze course focuses upon frequent and early reading of continuous Greek, progressing from Classical prose and poetry (such as Heraclitus, Xenophon) to the Greek of the New Testament. 

Students will also become familiar with relevant cultural history of Greece and Rome, which will open up a wealth of thought, culture, and literature which will be discussed informally throughout the term, and which you can connect with your learning in other classes.

By the end of the year, students will be excited and empowered to read, understand, and translate the New Testament directly from the original Greek. Advanced study will involved advanced declensions, conjugations, tenses, accent marks, and enclitics. 

Language-learning is a discipline built on rote memorization and immersion into the thought-patterns of a foreign time and place. The goal is not only to be able to translate English thoughts into Greek words but to "think in Greek" as soon as possible. As a result, students are expected to devote time and energy to memorizing vocabulary, practicing declension and conjugation forms, practicing "Grenglish" (speaking Greek and mixing in Enlighs vocabulary) and doing translations in and out of class. 


### Learning Goals:

* To memorize the Greek alphabet, especially new letters such as epsilon, upsilon, omicron, dzeta, theta, phi, chi, psi.
* To learn Greek word-concepts like 'logos', 'bios', 'paidos'.
* To read, understand, and translate short Greek sentences and longer Greek primary texts such as Plato, Xenophon, and the New Testament


### Required Texts:
*Athenaze: An Introduction to Ancient Greek.* Balme and Lawall *Athenaze Workbook I.* Lawall, Johnson and Miraglia
*A Readerâ€™s Greek New Testament.* Goodrich and Lukaszewski




### Scope, Sequence, and Grades:

This course is divided into four blocks, consisting of sixteen units of about two weeks each. Student work in each block consists of reading, discussion, and assessments. 





### Grading 

You will be graded primarily on reading, participation, and tests, plus applicable extra credit.
