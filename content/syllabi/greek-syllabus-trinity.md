### Provided Handouts
- Plato

- And more!




### Course Description:
This course aims to enable you to begin reading, understanding, and translating Ancient Greek. 

Following the "Athenaze" text and workbook, we will cover the fundamentals of the ancient Greek language, including the alphabet, pronunciation, grammar, and a working vocabulary of hundreds of common words. The Athanaze course focuses upon frequent and early reading of continuous Greek, progressing from Classical prose and poetry (such as Heraclitus, Xenophon, and Plato) to the New Testament. 

Students will also become familiar with relevant cultural history of Greece and Rome. Knowledge of these cultures will open up a wealth of thought and literature that connects to other classes and which will be discussed informally in Greek. 

By the end of the year, students will be excited and empowered to read, understand, and translate the New Testament directly from the original Greek. Advanced study will involved advanced declensions, conjugations, tenses, accent marks, and enclitics. 

Language-learning is a discipline built on rote memorization and immersion into the thought-patterns of a foreign time and place. The goal is not only to be able to translate English thoughts into Greek words but to "think in Greek" as soon as possible. As a result, students are expected to devote time and energy to memorizing vocabulary, practicing declension and conjugation forms, practicing "Grenglish" (speaking Greek and mixing in English vocabulary) and translating in and out of class. 


### Learning Goals:

* To memorize the Greek alphabet, especially new letters such as epsilon, upsilon, omicron, dzeta, theta, phi, chi, psi.
* To learn Greek word-concepts like 'logos', 'bios', 'paidos'.
* To master the basics of grammar: the conjugation of present tense, past tense, and future tense verbs; 1st, 2nd, and 3rd declension nouns, articles, adjectives, and participles. 
* To acquire a large Greek vocabulary of hundreds of words
* And finally, to read, understand, and translate short Greek sentences and longer Greek primary texts such as Plato, Xenophon, and the New Testament


### Required Texts:
*Athenaze: An Introduction to Ancient Greek.* Balme and Lawall *Athenaze Workbook I.* Lawall, Johnson and Miraglia
*A Reader’s Greek New Testament.* Goodrich and Lukaszewski




### Scope, Sequence, and Grades:

This course is divided into sixteen units of about two weeks each. Student work in each block consists of memorization, reading, quizzes, and eventually translation and composition. 



### Grading 

You will be graded primarily on reading, participation, and tests.

|  Assessment category                  |  %          |
| --------------------------------------|-------------|
| Participation                         | 25%         |  
| Quizzes                               | 20%         |
| Homework                              | 20%         |
| Exams                                 | 35%         |


The best way to earn an 'A' is to spend time every day memorizing new vocabulary and grammar forms and practicing what you have already learned, participate, and study well for the tests. Weekly and sometimes daily quizzes build to monthly or quarterly tests. 





### Participation:

One of the primary goals of this class is to improve in the live reading, understanding, and translating of Greek into good English (and English into Greek). Hence we will *speak* Greek and *read* Greek almost every class. 

To earn participation points, you will *voluntarily* share your thoughts in discussion *at least once per week* and respond when called upon. _You are responsible to talk in class._ Even if you are confused, tired, or unmotivated, I expect you to make yourself participate and engage. Get out of your comfort zone into your growth zone. Come _prepared_. Read, take notes, reflect, and come ready to share your viewpoint, defend it, listen to others’ viewpoints, and critique theirs.

Everyone starts at an 80% (B-) for the participation grade. Outstanding participation is marked by preparation, diligence, attentiveness, articulateness, insight, and respect.   You will move up or down depending on whether you pay attention and speak at least once per week. Other [discussion ground rules are posted online.](http://www.keithbuhler.com/discussion101)

Daily participation will be scored on a scale of 1-5, according to the following criteria:


### 5: 
Students always take a voluntary and active role in their own learning. They challenging themselves on a daily basis.  They consistently demonstrate a genuine desire to learn and share ideas with the teacher and their classmates.  They listen actively to others, initiate discussions, ask significant questions, provide creative and thoughtful insight and ideas, and act as leaders within the group.  These students are always well prepared to contribute. Their in-class work ethic and faithfulness with homework demonstrates their high regard for learning. 

 
### 4: 
Students consistently take an active role in their own learning.  They participate satisfactorily in class discussions and work.  They demonstrate preparation and thoughtfulness when prompted to respond with an answer, and are ready to ask questions and offer insight relevant to the work at hand.  They listen respectfully and display attentiveness towards others.

### 3: 
Students inconsistently take an active role in their own learning, sharing relevant ideas, asking appropriate questions, and answering thoughtfully.  They contribute sparingly to class discussions and work.  They may need occasional reminders to stay on task make the most of our class time, and to increase their level of commitment to the course.  In class, the work ethic and focus demonstrated generally needs improvement.

### 2: 
Students rarely take an active role in their own learning.  They often do not participate and rarely share ideas or ask questions.   As a result of being unprepared for or disengaged from class, these students are unable to offer ideas even when called upon.  In class, their work ethic and focus is significantly lacking.

### 1-0:
Students are absent, unprepared, disrespectful, inattentive, or otherwise posing a significant behavioral and/or academic concern in class.


### Quizzes

Short vocab and grammar quizzes will be given *frequently*. These quizzes assess how consistent and diligent you are being in memorizing new material. These are "easy points" if you are diligent. Some days may not have quizzes, and some quizzes will be a surprise (pop quiz, not announced). So always be prepared for a quiz!


### Tests/Exams

Tests and exams will assess how well you have mastered the core material of the class. In addition to periodic unit tests, students will take a fall final, and a spring final. Finals may be cumulative. 


### National Greek Examination

Also, students will take the NGE (National Greek Examination) in the spring (March). This test will compare student knowledge against more than 2,000 introductory Greek students nationally. Students can earn purple, blue, red, or green ribbons. 


### Quality Work Guidelines:

Only quality work from students will be accepted.  Quality work is clean, clear, properly titled, formatted, and stapled according to the assignment’s specifications.  Unless otherwise stated, electronic assignments are to be turned in online and paper assignments are to be hand-written and completed in pencil. When the use of pens is allowed, only black ink will be acceptable. 

Late work will not be accepted.  In the case of emergencies or absences known ahead of time, contact Dr. Buhler to develop a plan for satisfactory completion of required work.  Assignments will be considered on time when they are ready to be turned in at the beginning of class.
