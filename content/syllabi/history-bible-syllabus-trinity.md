### Required Books: 
- *English Standard Version of the Bible: ESV Study Bible.*
- Peter Leithart, *The Four: A Survey of the Gospels* 
- A three ring binder with dividers, devoted exclusively to this class

### Handouts (provided)
- Western Civilization; 8th Edition, Spielvogel 



### Course Description:
This course is intended cultivate careful reading and keen understanding of history and the Holy Scriptures.  By developing in one course the skill of reading and understanding, and by studying both history and Sacred Scripture, students can expect to gain a better appreciation for the ongoing dialog between man and God throughout history.

Specifically, this course covers the History of Rome and its impact on Western Civilization up through the Middle Ages. We cover about 1200 years, from 400 BC-600 AD, with special focus on 0-400 AD, during which time Rome became an empire, and in which Jesus lived, died, resurrected, and started the Church, which recorded its own history in the New Testament. 

Humanities is a discipline based upon the manipulation of abstract ideas, causes, and effects, as much as on the learning of concrete facts. The goal is formation of good thought patterns and excellent character, rather than mastery of a body of technical knowledge. As a result, Humanities coursework involves reading and discussion more than anything else. Humanities homework, when assigned, will generally involve reading and note-taking, but most of our work actually takes place in the classroom. 



### Learning Goals:

* To become familiar with the main contours of western history, such as Hellenistic Kingdoms, the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire
* To understand the Gospels and the New Testament in historical context
* To identify causes of major historical events
* To understand, test, and defend the Christian worldview applied to Greece, Israel, Rome, and the early Church.
* To become more virtuous and wise human beings in the pursuit of goodness, truth, and beauty.

### Attendance & Participation Rubric

You will be assessed on your daily participation in class.  

One of the primary goals of this class is to improve in our dialog skills. Much of class time is devoted to discussing the material because (1) You must take responsibility for your own learning. (2) We can actually get to know each other. (3) Most people learn (and retain) best in discussion. 

To earn participation points, you will *voluntarily* share your thoughts in discussion at least once per week, and/or respond when called upon. 

_You are responsible to talk in class._ Even if you are confused, tired, or unmotivated, I expect you to make yourself participate and engage. Get out of your comfort zone into your growth zone. Come _prepared_. Read, take notes, reflect, and come ready to share your viewpoint, defend it, listen to others’ viewpoints, and critique theirs.

Everyone starts at an 80% (B-) for the participation grade. You will move up or down depending on whether you pay attention and speak at least once per week. Other [discussion ground rules are posted online.](http://www.keithbuhler.com/discussion101)

Outstanding participation is marked by preparation, diligence, attentiveness, articulateness, insight, and respect.  

Daily participation will be scored on a scale of 1-10, according to the following criteria:

9-10:
Students always take a voluntary and active role in his or her own learning. They challenging themselves on a daily basis.  They consistently demonstrate a genuine desire to learn and share ideas with the teacher and their classmates.  They listen actively to others, initiate discussions, ask significant questions, provide creative and thoughtful insight and ideas, and act as leaders within the group.  These students are always well prepared to contribute to the class as a result of having thoughtfully completed assignments, and the thoroughness of their work demonstrates the high regard they hold for learning.  In class, they demonstrate a superior work ethic and focus on the tasks at hand.

 
8: 
Students consistently take an active role in their own learning.  They participate satisfactorily in class discussions and work.  They demonstrate preparation and thoughtfulness when prompted to respond with an answer, and are ready to ask questions and offer insight relevant to the work at hand.  They listen respectfully and display attentiveness towards others.

7: 
Students inconsistently take an active role in their own learning, sharing relevant ideas, asking appropriate questions, and answering thoughtfully.  They contribute sparingly to class discussions and work.  They may need occasional reminders to stay on task make the most of our class time, and to increase their level of commitment to the course.  In class, the work ethic and focus demonstrated generally needs improvement.

6: 
Students rarely take an active role in their own learning.  They often do not participate and rarely share ideas or ask questions.   As a result of being unprepared for or disengaged from class, these students are unable to offer ideas even when called upon.  In class, their work ethic and focus is significantly lacking.

0-5:
Students are absent, unprepared, disrespectful, inattentive, or otherwise posing a significant behavioral and/or academic concern in class.


### Reading tips:
Read for understanding, not just completion.  Read each book or chapter slowly and actively, pausing to ask yourself: What is the main thesis? Is it true? Take notes summarizing the story or argument of the text and your questions or opinions on that story.

Read as slowly as you must in order to read for understanding; you will get faster over time!

Talk with each other before class: What was the main point of the reading? What was especiallyconfusing? What especially interesting? Come to class with objections, questions, and arguments. 

### Quizzes

Short reading quizzes will occur each day to assess that you read the assigned text. These are "easy points" if you are diligent in reading.


### Tests/Exams

Tests and exams will assess how well you have mastered the core material of the class. That material includes dates, names, facts, concepts, causes, and arguments pertaining to the history of Greece, Rome, Persia, Israel, and the Early Church. 
 


### Quality Work Guidelines:

Only quality work from students will be accepted.  Quality work is clean, clear, properly titled, formatted, and stapled according to the assignment’s specifications.  Unless otherwise stated, assignments are to be hand-written and completed in pencil. When the use of pens is allowed, only black ink will be acceptable. 

Late work will not be accepted.  In the case of emergencies or absences known ahead of time, contact Dr. Buhler to develop a plan for satisfactory completion of required work.  Assignments will be considered on time when they are ready to be turned in at the beginning of class.
