### Course Description:

\indent

This course is intended to cultivate students' ability to argue well in conversation and in writing. More deeply, this course is intended to invite students into intellectual maturity by stoking their love of truth and fostering the joy of dialogue. 

Students will gain an appreciation and understanding of the vocabulary, concepts, problems, and relevance of a subset of the Great Ideas in the history of western philosophy. 

Students will acquire and practice this knowledge through close readings of Plato, Aristotle, and other primary sources. Students will form their own thoughts by arguing in conversation and in writing. 

This course also reviews all prior stages of the Progymnasmata and covers the last stage: Thesis and Law. Students will learn to state a thesis/law clearly, provide arguments in its support, and state objections or counterarguments, and then respond to reasonable objections to their own thesis. 

Humanities is a discipline based upon the manipulation of abstract ideas as much as on the learning of concrete facts. As a result, humanities coursework and homework consists primarily in in-class discussion, or assigned reading and writing. 



### Learning Goals:

* To become familiar with the basic vocabulary of western philosophy (metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, cosmology, etc.)
* To understand Plato, Aristotle, and other seminal philosophers in their historical context and as thinkers relevant for us today
* To review the Progymnasmata stages of fable, narrative, chreia/maxim, refutation/confirmation, and encomium/invective. 
* To introduce the final stage o the Progymnasmata: Thesis/Law
* To identify arguments for and against major positions in ethics, politics, metaphysics, and epistemology
* To practice conversational inquiry (dialectic) into abstract topics as well as one's own life 
* To understand, test, and defend the Christian worldview applied to God, man, the universe, right and wrong, and human communities
* To become more virtuous and wise by pursuing truth and goodness 

### Scope, Sequence:

This course is divided into two semesters -- one on Aristotle and one on Plato. Each semester is framed with discussions about the challenge and privilege of being Christians who are called to live the life of the mind. 


### Grades: 

Student work in each unit consists of reading, discussion, and assessments. Therefore, the best way to earn an 'A' is to read carefully, participate, and write. 

You will be graded primarily on reading, participation, and tests.

|  Assessment category                  |  %          |
| --------------------------------------|-------------|
| Participation                         | 30%         |  
| Papers                                | 30%         |
| Note checks                           | 15%         |
| Quizzes                               | 15%         |
| Symposium                             | 10%         |

 


### Participation Rubric:

<<<<<<< HEAD
One of the primary goals of this class is to improve in the skill of intellectual dialogue in a group. Such discussion is necessary because (1) You must take responsibility for your own learning, (2) discussion helps us to get to know each other, and (3) most people learn and retain material better in discussion. 

To earn participation points, you will *voluntarily* share your thoughts in discussion *at least once per week* and respond when called upon. _You are responsible to talk in class._ Even if you are confused, tired, or unmotivated, I expect you to make yourself participate and engage. Get out of your comfort zone into your growth zone. Come _prepared_. Read, take notes, reflect, and come ready to share your viewpoint, defend it, listen to others’ viewpoints, and critique theirs.

Everyone starts at an 80% participation grade for the week and earns a higher or lower grade based on performance. Outstanding participation is marked by preparation, diligence, attentiveness, articulateness, insight, and respect.   You will move up or down depending on whether you pay attention and speak at least once per week. Other [discussion ground rules are posted online.](http://www.keithbuhler.com/discussion101)

### 9-10:
Students always take a voluntary and active role in their own learning. They challenge themselves on a daily basis.  They consistently demonstrate a genuine desire to learn and share ideas with the teacher and their classmates.  They listen actively to others, initiate discussions, ask significant questions, provide creative and thoughtful insight and ideas, and act as leaders within the group.  These students are always well prepared to contribute. Their in-class work ethic and faithfulness with homework demonstrates their high regard for learning. 

 
### 8: 
Students consistently take an active role in their own learning.  They participate satisfactorily in class discussions and work.  They demonstrate preparation and thoughtfulness when prompted to respond with an answer, and are ready to ask questions and offer insight relevant to the work at hand.  They listen respectfully and display attentiveness towards others.

### 7:
Students inconsistently take an active role in their own learning, sharing relevant ideas, asking appropriate questions, and answering thoughtfully.  They contribute sparingly to class discussions and work.  They may need occasional reminders to stay on task make the most of our class time, and to increase their level of commitment to the course.  In class, the work ethic and focus demonstrated generally needs improvement.

### 6: 
Students rarely take an active role in their own learning.  They often do not participate and rarely share ideas or ask questions.   As a result of being unprepared for or disengaged from class, these students are unable to offer ideas even when called upon.  In class, their work ethic and focus is significantly lacking.

### 1-5:
Students are absent, unprepared, disrespectful, inattentive, or otherwise posing a significant behavioral and/or academic concern in class.
=======
Everyone earns a 4/5 (80%) for the participation grade. Outstanding participation is marked by preparation, diligence, attentiveness, articulateness, insight, and respect.   You will move up or down depending on whether you pay attention and speak at least once per week. Other [discussion ground rules are posted online.](http://www.keithbuhler.com/discussion101)

### Reading tips:
Read for understanding, not just completion.  Read each book or chapter slowly and actively, pausing to ask yourself: What is the main thesis? Is it true? Take notes summarizing the story or argument of the text and your questions or opinions on that story.  Read as slowly as you must in order to read for understanding; you will get faster over time! Also, talk with each other before class: What was the main point of the reading? What was especially confusing? What especially interesting? Come to class with objections, questions, and arguments. 

### Quizzes:

Short reading quizzes or "pull questions" may be assigned. These assess that you read the assigned text. These are "easy points" if you are diligent in reading. Some days may not have reading quizzes, and some quizzes may not be announced. So always be prepared for a quiz!


### Tests/Papers:

Tests and exams will assess how well you have mastered the core material of the class. Tests may consist of short to medium-length papers covering assigned topics or term papers covering a breadth of topics.  
 


### Quality Work Guidelines:

Only quality work from students will be accepted.  Quality work is clean, clear, properly titled, formatted, and stapled according to the assignment’s specifications.  Unless otherwise stated, electronic assignments are to be turned in online and paper assignments are to be hand-written and completed in pencil. When the use of pens is allowed, only black ink will be acceptable. 

### Late Work Policy:
Assignments are due at the beginning of class unless otherwise stated. *Late work will not be accepted.*  Late assignments are inputted in the gradebook as a zero. 

That said, any student may request an extension (of 1-7 days) on any assignment at any time. That request may be denied. In general, it is advised to work ahead, and plan carefully, to avoid turning assignments in late or requesting extensions. 

Invalid excuses for late work include printer failure, internet failure, forgetting, being busy, being tardy to class, and more. Diligent and proactive students will find a way to overcome these common problems and get the assignment in on time. When in doubt, print and email the assignment in order to prevent a zero. 

Valid exceptions to the "no late work" policy are:  1. Illness: missed assignments due to excused absences resulting from illness are automatically extended, then due the first day the student returns, unless a further extension is granted. (It is the student's responsibility to find out from the teacher or fellow students what is due.)  2. Planned absences: missed deadlines resulting from vacations, sports games, college trips, etc., are extended then due the day a student returns, unless a further extension is granted. (A good practice is to turn in assignments *before* the planned absence.)   3. Teacher discretion: the teacher may choose to offer a retroactive extension out of courtesy if it seems appropriate, though a point deduction of 10%-50% may be applied. It is not advised that students be optimistic about their chances of receiving such an extension. 

In sum, students should foster the habit of turning in completed assignments by the beginning of class on the day they are due.
