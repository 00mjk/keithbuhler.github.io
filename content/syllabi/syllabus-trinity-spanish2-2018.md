### Course Description:
The goal of this Spanish course is to develop your ability to speak Spanish. Students who take responsibility for their learning will find themselves able to speak, read, and understand Spanish. 

Students are expected to learn to use Spanish for communication in real, meaningful situations. It is also intended that students develop an understanding of basic grammatical concepts and an appreciation various Spanish speaking cultures.

To attain these goals, the first year courses focus on using Spanish as much as possible for classroom interaction.

Students will follow the *Avancemos!* textbook as well as supplemental materials provided electronically. Starting with alphabet and pronunciation, students will acquire basic vocabulary and grammar. They will also  learn Spanish concepts that don't quite translate directly into English words. 

Language-learning is a discipline built on rote memorization and immersion into the thought-patterns of a foreign time and place. The goal is not only to be able to translate English thoughts into Spanish words but to "think in Spanish" as soon as possible. As a result, students are expected to devote time and energy to memorizing vocabulary, practicing declension and conjugation forms, practicing "Spanglish" (speaking Spanish and mixing in English vocabulary) and translating in and out of class. 


### Learning Goals:

* To memorize the proper Latin American pronunciation of each letter of the alphabet
* To learn Spanish word-concepts like 'me gusta' (I am pleased), ' me llamo' (I call myself), and 'se me olvido' (it forgot me). 
* To memorize the lyrics to Spanish songs and tongue twisters
* To master the basics of grammar: the conjugation of present tense, preterit tense, imperfect tense, and future tense verbs
* To acquire a Spanish vocabulary of 1000 words
* And finally, to read, understand, and translate Spanish sentences and longer Spanish primary texts such as fairy tales, Bible passages, news, and items of popular culture


### Required Texts:

* ¡Avancemos!

### Provided Handouts:
- 620 Words
- Conjugation charts
- Fairy tales, the Creed, Bible stories, etc.


### Scope, Sequence, and Grades:

This course is divided into sixteen units of about two weeks each. Student work in each block consists of memorization, reading, quizzes, and eventually translation and composition. 



### Grading 

You will be graded primarily on reading, participation, and tests.

|  Assessment category                  |  %          |
| --------------------------------------|-------------|
| Participation                         | 20%         |  
| Homework                              | 20%         |
| Quizzes                               | 20%         |
| Final Exams                           | 40%         |


The best way to earn an 'A' is to spend time every day memorizing new vocabulary and grammar forms and practicing what you have already learned, participate, and study well for the tests. Weekly and sometimes daily quizzes build to monthly or quarterly tests. 





### Participation:

One of the primary goals of this class is to improve in the live reading, understanding, and translating of Spanish into good English (and English into Spanish). Hence we will *speak* and *read* Spanish almost every class. 

To earn participation points, you will *voluntarily* share your thoughts in discussion *at least once per class*, in addition to responding when called upon. _You are responsible to talk in class._ Even if you are confused, tired, or unmotivated, I expect you to make yourself participate and engage. Get out of your comfort zone into your growth zone. Come _prepared_. Read, take notes, reflect, and come ready to share your viewpoint, defend it, listen to others’ viewpoints, and critique theirs.

Outstanding participation is marked by preparation, diligence, attentiveness, articulateness, insight, and respect.   You will move up or down depending on whether you pay attention and speak at least once per week. Other [discussion ground rules are posted online.](http://www.keithbuhler.com/discussion101)

Daily participation will be scored on a scale of 1-10, according to the following criteria:


### 9-10: 
Students always take a voluntary and active role in their own learning. They challenging themselves on a daily basis.  They consistently demonstrate a genuine desire to learn and share ideas with the teacher and their classmates.  They listen actively to others, initiate discussions, ask significant questions, provide creative and thoughtful insight and ideas, and act as leaders within the group.  These students are always well prepared to contribute. Their in-class work ethic and faithfulness with homework demonstrates their high regard for learning. 

 
### 8: 
Students consistently take an active role in their own learning.  They participate satisfactorily in class discussions and work.  They demonstrate preparation and thoughtfulness when prompted to respond with an answer, and are ready to ask questions and offer insight relevant to the work at hand.  They listen respectfully and display attentiveness towards others.

### 7: 
Students inconsistently take an active role in their own learning, sharing relevant ideas, asking appropriate questions, and answering thoughtfully.  They contribute sparingly to class discussions and work.  They may need occasional reminders to stay on task make the most of our class time, and to increase their level of commitment to the course.  In class, the work ethic and focus demonstrated generally needs improvement.

### 4-5: 
Students rarely take an active role in their own learning.  They often do not participate and rarely share ideas or ask questions.   As a result of being unprepared for or disengaged from class, these students are unable to offer ideas even when called upon.  In class, their work ethic and focus is significantly lacking.

### 1-3:
Students are absent, unprepared, disrespectful, inattentive, or otherwise posing a significant behavioral and/or academic concern in class.


### Quizzes

Short vocab and grammar quizzes will be given *frequently*. These quizzes assess how consistent and diligent you are being in memorizing new material. Be diligent. Some days may not have quizzes, and some quizzes will be a surprise (pop quiz, not announced). So always be prepared!


### Tests/Exams

Tests and exams will assess how well you have mastered the core material of the class. In addition to periodic unit tests, students will take a fall final, and a spring final. Finals may be cumulative. 



### Quality Work Guidelines:

Only quality work from students will be accepted.  Quality work is clean, clear, properly titled, formatted, and stapled according to the assignment’s specifications.  Unless otherwise stated, electronic assignments are to be turned in online to Google Classroom and paper assignments are to be hand-written and completed in pencil or black ink pen. 

Late work will not be accepted.  In the case of emergencies or absences known ahead of time, contact Dr. Buhler to develop a plan for satisfactory completion of required work.  Assignments will be considered on time when they are ready to be turned in at the beginning of class.
