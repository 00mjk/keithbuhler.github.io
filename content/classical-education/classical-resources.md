## The purpose of education. 

What is the purpose of education? Traditionally, education has had to distinct purposes-- perhaps we should say that traditionally there have been two related forms of education. 

The first aim of education is to liberate students. The successfully educated person is free, free to think, live, and thrive within his community. This is traditionally described as a liberal education: the liberal arts reading, writing, literature, rhetoric, logic, geometry, arithmetic history and so on. The liberated individual is capable of thinking for himself of leading his community of setting goals and achieving of commanding his life his property, his family to settled ends. Such a person has a distinct value for the community. He or she may serve in the role of governing, writing, leading a church or organization teaching, preaching. A class in which students might ask "Am I ever going to use this?" like history or algebra II is geared towards the subject matter not for the sake of some particular skill but simply for knowledge and the beneficial affect that that knowledge has on the developing mind. 

The second aim of education is to equip students with technical skills needed to perform valuable jobs in the community. The successfully educated person is a capable professional in some trade or craft. Since the word 'technician' and 'technology' have more narrow connotations in our contemporary parlance, we should pause on this word for a moment. The Greek word techne means skill or craft. A carpenter is a technician in the sense since he is capable of harvesting conditioning manipulating wood putting it together into useful forms, as when he builds a house or a piece of furniture or a tool. But also a medical doctor has techne--he knows how the human body works, and perhaps has some special knowledge of one part of the body, like the heart or the eyes, ears, and nose. A farmer is a technician with the practical skills of producing edible food, storing it, and getting it into people's hands. We can see using this broader sense of the word that the information technology professional, also, is a tecnician, not because he works with electrified technology but because he has the knowledge needed to build, fix, or design new computers useful for performing complicated tasks. An architect is a technician, since he has the knowledge of how to design electrical systems for an office building, or how to build Many, many technically proficient individuals are capable of performing some task building or fixing some object useful to the community. They are capable of serving in roles of building cars or houses designing new spaceships or airplanes. My parents' generation had techne oriented classes like "Shop" or "Home economics" where they learned certainly some theory but focused on practical skills. 

Both forms of education are highly necessary it is needless to say. Both forms have a political dimension. Since man is a 'social animal' by nature, education exists within a community or polity wherein the older generation educates the younger generation, inducting them into the social life of the community. Every person who is a young student today will be a member of society. Tomorrow. They will serve in some social role and they will be an important member of their communities, social groups, friendships, family, church relationships.

But what's important for our purposes is to notice that liberal arts have a unique place in education. Their uniqueness is due to two factors: the first factor is that liberal education undergirds all technical education. By this I mean that the master skills of speaking and thinking and reasoning well are just as much a part of the practice of law as they are a part of driving a bus. This common basis for all learning in language, thought, reading, writing, and calculating lends special importance to the liberal arts. Without them, the void is felt. We all encountered someone, perhaps who is competent in his job but has poor communication skills. One of my bosses when I worked in construction was an excellent general contractor but struggled to communicate with me and his other employees exactly what he wanted us to do and exactly how to do it. In other words, to state something uncontroversial it would be folly, and inefficient too, to try to train someone to be an architect before teaching them to read!

The second factor that places liberal arts in a unique position in education is perhaps best illustrated by story. Consider farmer Charles let's suppose the farmer Charles lives in an early American Township in New England. What does he do on a typical day? He wakes up early works on harvesting or planting his crops takes care of the animals, and perhaps mends a broken tool. Then he rides his horse into town to sell milk and eggs to the town merchant by the few necessities. Then he stops by the town church to talk to the parson, confess his sins and donate a little bit of milk and cheese to the church is a tithe. On his way home he stops by the public house for a drink with his friends and talks politics in town gossip, hears and tells a few jokes, and goes on his way. At home, he eats the dinner that his wife cooked and sits around the table with his children quizzing them on their days activities. As a family. They sing a chorus or two after dinner, and sit out under the stars while he reads aloud from a book that they have acquired or inherited. Perhaps the Bible or a novel, then he goes to bed. 

What we notice in this little illustration is that only part of Charles's day is taken up with the technical activity and skill of farming the rest of it is taken up with talking with friends singing with his family, reading and enjoying relationship. 

Liberal education aims to equip Charles to live his life. His whole life with flourishing. What is the practical use of singing? Perhaps for a professional singer who earns their wages by singing it could be considered a practical activity. But for Charles singing is simply part of the joy of his daily life. What is the practical use of talking politics with his friends? Or looking at the stars? Charles is an excellent thinker and debates persuasively, and he knows quite a bit about the stars--but these skills do not directly concern his success as a farmer. 

The point here is to observe that the liberal arts take aim at the specifically human side of life. To this day. They are called the humanities, history, literature and philosophy and we might include the arts, music, theater, dance, painting, sculpture, and so on. These activities though they may have a more highly specialized or professional aspect for some people, are common to all people. They are universal. Everybody philosophizes (perhaps not with profession-specific vocabulary!), everybody enjoys music, and most everybody creates something, whether it's choosing an artful outfit to wear in the morning or cooking a new dish for dinner. 

The liberal arts help men and women to thrive as human beings. They also serve to equip some people to serve some specialized functions in society, just like the technical arts do--but these two factors, commonality and universality undergird other forms of learning and help give shape to the daily meaning and purpose of ordinary human life. 

With these two purposes of education in mind the classical school is both more modest and more ambitious in its aims, then the public school down the street. More modest in that we have cut out the plurality of topics and subjects that the typical school includes some high schools even incorporating electives into their curriculum! By focusing on the master skills of reading, language, writing, arguing, calculating, and speaking, we leverage every minute spent in class to the greatest possible effect. Students are not only learning their subject, but they're learning how to learn. They're not only receiving the great body of knowledge that is the treasure of Western civilization, but they are recovering the lost tools of learning themselves whereby they are equipped to serve the community in myriad capacities to thrive as human beings and to continue learning for the rest of their lives. We are also more ambitious in that a quick study of history reveals just how much students are capable of learning and accomplishing by their 16th year of age-- so we hold students to that standard. Our graduates are ready to apply for useful and rewarding jobs, or to apply to the Buhler College, where they can learn a real trade from real professionals in that field. In other words, we are confidently sending these remarkable young people into a successful place in the workforce or a promising role in higher education by the age in which my generation was taking Economics, Spanish III, and preparing college applications. 

Graduates of classical schools like ours are remarkably well equipped. They are engaging, articulate thinkers and sharp, capable doers. They are bright-eyed and ready to mantle the full responsibilities of adulthood in their community. Whereas in the old model high school was simply a preparation for college and college merely a preparation for a job classical schools are re-thinking a model, drawing on the best of the classical traditions and the best of our modern traditions. We are not perfect in our execution, but our graduates find that they are prepared for college a job and for a flourishing life.

Get to know our model.  We think you'll be impressed with our students. We sure are. 


## The master skills: reading, writing, speaking 

Boethius, De Arithmetica, Migne LXIII, 1079d: 'it was impossible to achieve the summit of perfection in the disciplines of philosophy ounless one approached this noble wisdom by a kind of fourfould [quadrivium] way'


## Job training. 

The "other" purpose of education is job training. There are as many jobs as you like, and so there is no one way to train people for jobs in advance of knowing, for sure, what job they are going to do. 

## A tried and true curriculum. 

The "classus" of "classical" education is simply the 

6. Community 
7. Values formation. 
8. Age grade topic. 
9. Modules vs. grades ("they feel bad" real life isn't age stratified) 
10. Schools that are getting it right. 
11. The great books (real life) 
12. Time manging, time bungling (wasted time in school compared to work week) 
13. Independence, self-starter vs. working hard (real life) 
14. Sequence time vs. project time (real life) 
15. Depth of topics vs. width of topics (real life) 
16. Adulthood vs. adolescence (real life)  
17. Doing what I love vs. doing what we need (entitlement culture) 
18. Rights vs. Justice (entitlement culture) 
19. "Work hard" vs. creative, taking risks, stepping out (entitlement culture) 
20. Event coordination and project management vs. Task accomplishment 
21. Facts & information (memorize) vs. master (understanding) familiarity, truths? 
22. Corey: Classical education, cultural perception of teaching profession vs. practicalities of day-to-day school life 


## Administrators vs. Educators 

One of the many social fractures of modern society is the fracture between leaders and their followers. A healthy society consists of a series of interlocking trust relationships between those who lead, command, direct and those who are follow, obey, and are directed. Good leaders are servants of their servants, and good followers love and trust their leaders. Neither expects perfection of the other and so both have patience for the other. 

In a school, the basic transaction is the transfer of knowledge from teacher to student (or the mutual acquisition of knowledge, from a book, by teacher and student.) Therefore, the practical fundament are a time and place for teacher and student to meet. In the earliest schools, teachers performed these simple and basic fundamental administrative tasks. 

Our modern context values specialization over generalization, and "expertise" of the "manager" (often false and sophistic) over the activity of the amateur. 

In a classical school, teachers should lead and leaders should teach. 

## Compulsory vs. Voluntary 



## Trivium/Quadrivium vs. “Subjects” 

>The Pythagoreans considered all mathematical science to be divided into four parts: one half they marked off as concerned with quantity, the other half with magnitude; and each of these they posited as twofold. A quantity can be considered in regard to its character by itself or in its relation to another quantity, magnitudes as either stationary or in motion. Arithmetic, then, studies quantities as such, music the relations between quantities, geometry magnitude at rest, spherics [astronomy] magnitude inherently moving. [Proclus, _A commentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements_, xii, trans. Glenn Raymond Morrow (Princeton: Princeton University Press) 1992, pp. 29-30. ISBN 0-691-02090-6.](http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic555335.files/Proclus.pdf)

Put differently, the quadrivium studies number in four modes: pure number (arithmetic), stationary number (geometry), moving number (astronomy) and applied number (music) number.
