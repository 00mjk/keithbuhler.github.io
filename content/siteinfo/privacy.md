### Introduction

There is a growing trend of sites being clear how they collect and use visitor information.[^1] This is a positive trend, in my view. Even when it is not strictly necessary, full disclosure should be encouraged. The bottom line is that I will never use or sell your information to others. 

## Cookies and Log Files

Like nearly all websites, keithbuhler.com may store cookies on your computer. These collect information but I have no access or control over them. To disable cookies, use your browser's settings. We also use log files to help learn about when, from where and how often traffic flows to this site, such is IP, type of browser, number of clicks, etc. None of this type of information is linked to anything that is personally identifiable.

### Amazon Affiliates

I am an "Amazon Affiliate" which means I earn a very small commission on products you buy on Amazon.com after entering through [any of my pages](http://amzn.to/2hIJTol). Amazon offers these commissions in exchange for sites like myself to advertise for them and drive traffic to their market. These commissions are very small (usually around 3%) but they can accumulate and help me to feed my family and continue providing you content. 

Furthermore, these small commissions *never* cost you any extra money, and I will never recommend a product just to make a sale. I only link to products (mostly books) that I have read and honestly enjoy and commend to your interest. 

Amazon uses cookies to help make sure I get a commission when you buy a product after clicking on a link or ad banner that takes you to the site of one of their merchants. You can read [Amazon’s Privacy Policy.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496)

>keithbuhler.com is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com, amazonsupply.com, or myhabit.com.


### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a web analytics tool I use to help understand how visitors engage with this website. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors. You can read [Google Analytics Privacy Policy.](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) Also, you can use [Google's Chrome app](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to opt out of analytic data collection.

### Google Site Stats

To measure performance, Google uses small strings of text (known as cookies) that are placed on your computer when you click on ads. Cookies typically remain active on your computer for about 30 days. If you visit certain pages of the advertiser’s website during that period, Google and the advertiser will be able to tell that you saw the ad delivered by Google. You can read more about [Google Site Stats here.](https://services.google.com/sitestats/en_US.html?cid=1060759437)

### MailChimp

Subscribers may choose to receive email updates via MailChimp by submitting an email address to the email subscription form. I use a secure opt-in subscription system and I reserve the right to contact subscribers with information related to this website and blog. Subscribers may unsubscribe anytime and every email delivered will contain an “Unsubscribe” link.

Thank you for reading.
