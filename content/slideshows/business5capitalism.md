###  What is "capitalism"? 

Google: "an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state."

[Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism): ": a way of organizing an economy so that the things that are used to make and transport products (such as land, oil, factories, ships, etc.) are owned by individual people and companies rather than by the government"

Synonyms: "free enterprise", "private enterprise", "free market"

Capital: wealth; i.e., cash or possibly assets like land and employees.

### What is capitalism?

MacDonald's owns their stuff. You own your stuff. Starbucks owns their stuff. Keeneland owns their land. 

The government "owns" (and manages them for our communal ownership) public parks, the White House, Frankfurt, military equipment, etc.

### Alternatives: Communism

- Communism is the "positive abolition of private property" -- Marx. (75)


</section>
<section data-markdown>        

### Alternatives: Socialism

> "a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole."... "(in Marxist theory) a transitional social state between the overthrow of capitalism and the realization of communism."

</section>
<section data-markdown>        


### Alternatives

>Like communism, socialism seeks to redistribute the wealth more equitably by the communal ownership of natural resources and major industries, such as banking and public utilities. Socialists also seek to nationalize monopolies, which greatly enrich their owners at the expense of the proletariat. However, unlike communism, most small or nonessential enterprises would remain privately owned. Also unlike the Communists, most socialists do not advocate violence or force to achieve their economic system.[(Citation)](http://thismatter.com/economics/economic-systems.htm)

### How Much can you own? 

* "Maximally extensive feasible property rights:" Bob gets to use his property free of government coercion, or private theft: use it, exclude others from using it, manage it, receive compensation if damaged, waste it, trade it, sell it, rent it.  (75-6)
* In practice, there are limitations on Bob's property rights (zoning laws, historic districts, taxation)
* Anarcho-capitalism wants *no* taxation (77)

### The Tragedy of commons

>The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting that resource through their collective action.

</section>
<section data-markdown>        

### The Tragedy of commons

- Who should intervene? 
- Private conscience, private firm, trade association, non-profit, non-compulsory state body, compulsory state law, or something else

### The Tragedy of commons

>“Nor can certain harmful effects of deforestation, or of some methods of farming, or of the smoke and noise of factories, be confined to the owner of the property in question or to those who are willing to submit to the damage for an agreed compensation.  In such instances we must find some substitute for the regulation by the price mechanism.  

</section>
<section data-markdown>        

### The Tragedy of commons

>But the fact that we have to resort to the substitution of direct regulation by authority where the conditions for the proper working of competition cannot be created, does not prove that we should suppress competition where it can be made to function.”  (Hayek, 1944)
