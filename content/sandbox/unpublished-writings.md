I am a devout amateur, which means 'lover.' Everyone should create things because they love the intrinsic value of creating and love the object, whether it makes money or not. Whether you write, draw, sculpt, code, conduct, or something else, it is human to create. In that spirit, this site captures a few of my articles, short stories, fairy tales, screenplays, poems, and satire, some of which have been published elsewhere. Hope you enjoy.
