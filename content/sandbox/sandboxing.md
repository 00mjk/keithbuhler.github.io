If you want to innovate, you have to play. 

If you want to create, you have to engage in low-risk experiments. 

If you want to succeed, you have to develop a high failure tolerance. 

I call this kind of play, experimentation, and controlled failure "sandboxing."

In software development, a [sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)) is:

>A testing environment that isolates untested code changes... from the production environment. 



Play is preparation; play is necessary for brain growth. Kids who play xbox or what not have higher 10-20% brain growth. “Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi said play is a flow state where we have just the right balance of challenge and opportunity given our skill sets; in the state of play we are so completely absorbed by our activity to the point which nothing else in the world seems to matter.”(https://www.good.is/articles/how-to-be-more-productive-and-creative-at-work-play-more) “Classrooms instill a fear of mistakes, and don’t put enough emphasis on imagination, intuition, or spontaneity. But without enough play, we lose creativity. Studies show that humans can have a play deficit just like the well-documented sleep deficit. Adults who play are actually shown to be more productive at work and in business than adults who do not play. “ “The first condition is having the confidence to fail, so that you can take risks within your work.”

- Structure of a Sandbox: 
    - Sand, the raw material to play with.
    - Box to contain the sand within bounds.
    - Tactile hands to feel the sand tactily and to manipulate it. 
    - Forms, shovels, to mold and shape the sand.
    - Water, to modify the raw material according to spectrum of soft, to hard, to soft again. 
    - Ideas: I could make a castle! or a hill! or a hole in the ground! Or write letters! or…!

- Examples: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Room_coffee_pot
    - Sand: camera, computers, and a network.
    - Box: a single camera
    - Hands: the programmers playing with the X Window system protocols
    - Forms: existing imaging software, existing transmission software
    - Ideas: I could take a picture of the current state of the coffee pot and transmit it to all the members of the Computer Lab at Cambridge. 

Example: the Wright Brothers’ airplane
- Sand: bike parts, printing presses, motors, and machines, spruce wood, 
- Box: a size, shape, and wind-tunnel
- Forms: wings, engines, and control sticks; bird wings, bikes, cars, trains
- Ideas: we could make flying machine that is controllable by the pilot!
- The brothers played with a small toy helicopter when they were 6 and 11, respectively, which they played with until it broke. Then they built a new one themselves. They conceived and built and reconciled and rebuilt hundreds of machines. They built the Flyer I, the Flyer II, the Flyer III. Iteration after iteration. 


Wonderland: how triviality is the mother of invention. People make the most breakthroughs where they are having the most fun. People enjoy themselves, do things for their own sake — those people are more innovative than some

We’re talking a lot about this tone and the comedy, how does it then reconnect to what the plot of the movie is about?
I have no idea. Honestly, I gave it a little bit of thought, but sometimes, often I was like, You know what? I’m gonna let Marvel deal with that. That’s their department. I know how to tell a story, but I’m having so much fun subverting all of this, and like telling weird jokes and making this the weirdest Marvel movie ever. If you’ve seen my movies, you don’t hire me for any reason other than what I’ve done.

So Marvel’s job really is to look after their characters, look after their source material, and make sure I don’t completely break it, or it doesn’t negatively affect the rest of the movies or how they all interweave. I don’t understand that, and I’ve never watched all those movies with the eye of like, Oh, how does this link up? Oh, what year was this when, like, Fury encountered this thing? That’s why it was a good partnership. If I’d written it and been really hung up on my words and the intricacies of the story and the Marvel lore, I probably would have had a worse time and probably would have been controlled a lot more. But as it stood, I focused on things that I think I’m good at, and Marvel gave me so much freedom to run with that and play in that sandbox, knowing that they could just keep me in my lane
