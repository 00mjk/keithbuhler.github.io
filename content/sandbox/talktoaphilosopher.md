You have a question about metaphysics, ethics, or philosophy of religion but don't know where to even start.  You can talk to me at $50 for 20 minutes. 

(Have a question about physics? [Talk to Sabine!](http://backreaction.blogspot.com/p/talk-to-physicist_27.html))

To set up an appointment, please send an email to info at keithbuhler dot com. Tues/Thurs are usually best. I can use Google Hangout, Skype, or Facetime.


*Terms and conditions:* 

The payment is to be made by [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/keithbuhler). Half of the fee is due at least 24 hours before the scheduled call, the other half after completion. If the conversation does not take place due to fault on our side, you get a full refund. If you feel that we have not delivered the service we offer, you do not have to pay the 2nd half of the fee. In this case, however we require a written explanation of our shortcoming.

During our conversation, you can ask us anything you want to know about philosophy!

My own expertise is in: ethics, virtue ethics, Plato and Aristotle, the history of philosophy, and the relationship between Christianity and philosophy. 

If your topic of interest is something else, I am developing a team which will include experts on: metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of science, and more, all with PhDs. I am sure we can get you covered. 

We do not counsel students for homework assignments.
