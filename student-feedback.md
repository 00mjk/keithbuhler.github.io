# Student Feedback


## Good

### Readings

" Many of the texts were very interesting. I appreciate that the Prof. Buhler understood the struggle of learning Philosophy at 8:00 in the morning."(PHL293 2016)

### Lectures

"This professor is passionate about what he teaches his students, and is really good at keeping the class engaged. He is very knowledgeable." (2015, PHL200)

"The course was really interesting, and the teacher was very engaging. I expected this gen-ed to not be fun, but he made it interesting, fun, and I learned a lot about how to think differently about things."(2015, PHL200)


"Keep drawing on the board! I'm a visual learner and your drawings are very helpful."

### Classroom Environment and respect

"Instructor made the course. Great environment to learn and discuss- made the classroom a comfortable place to share ideas and grow in knowledge. One of my favorite professors."(2015, PHL200)

"Buhler is a fantastic teacher. He is very theatrical about philosophy which is great. He treats us like adults and enjoys discussion. He really brings out the best about philosophy. None of his assignments are busy work. He learned our names very quickly and took time to understand our points in discussion. He is very knowledgeable about many things and has a very open view to discussion."

### Discussion

"Very engaging teaching style. Allowed a lot of room for class discussion providing a fun and engaging learning environment."(PHL293 2016)

"â€¢ I loved the class discussions. Buhler always encouraged in class discussions and cared about us as people."(PHL293 2016)

"I enjoyed pretty much every aspect of the class. I really liked that I was able to process on my own and post about it since I hate talking in class. I also liked that even though I generally don't like to, I never felt too intimidated to speak when I wanted to because the environment was so friendly and conductive to learning and participation." 

### Participation without discussion

"Allowed different means of participation. Rather than making each student participate out loud in class, he provided ways for different types of learners to meet that portion of their grade. He made a fun learning environment. He did not treat us like we are in high school, he treated us like adults and like college students should be treated. He realized that we are capable of making decisions for ourselves and that we are responsible for ourselves. He respected us as students." (PHL 200 2015)

"I have a tough time thinking outside the box in a philosophical manner so this course really challenged me. I am grateful that the internal/external processor idea was put into action because I freak out if I have to talk in front of the class." (2015, PHL200)


### Writing

### Quizzes

### Busy work


"The vast majority was discussion driven. Most other Philosophy classes I hear of are filled with terms, theories, and endless quizes. This class was focused on having the class externally or internally process the topics we went over. The reading in the course was not some impersonal textbook with dates, names, and definitions. We read the words of actual philosophers." (PHL200, 2015)

"I enjoyed that the main focus of this course was not about the grade, but more outlined on learning and understanding ethical concepts and formulating your own opinion on them." (PHI305-002 2016)

### Philosophical Content

"I really enjoyed this course and it has helped me grow in my faith more than any other class I have taken."(PHL200)

"I liked the way that he challenged our views on life and the fundamental concepts of everything." (PHL200 2014)

### Gratuitous Praise

"Mr. Buhler is probably the best Prof I have ever had. He has a genuine interest in the student and spends time outside of class and office hours with students to help them succeed. He is not only interested in producing excellent students, but excellent human beings. He provokes thought and helps students to reach new places of understanding. Mr. Buhler is excellent." (PHL200 2015)

"Prof Buhler was an incredible teacher. I have a tough time thinking outside the box in a philosophical manner so this course really challenged me. I am grateful that the internal/external processor idea was put into action because I freak out if I have to talk in front of the class. I wish I hadn't been so sick this semester though because I got a lot more out of actually going to class than I did doing things on my own. I might not have enjoyed participating in the discussion, but I've always been more of an observer anyways and the things that students said really intrigued me and forced me to think."

"Prof. Buhler is really great. I have been recommending the course and him to all my friends. Honestly, this course was the one this semester that I enjoyed going to the most and got the most out of. And maybe while I didn't quite show it, every class period left me with more questions about our world and left me with a feeling like I was understanding things in a new light. Honestly, I wish Prof. Buhler would teach all of my classes here are Asbury. Even if he didn't know the subject matter, I would still come for the jokes, and doodles on the board, and the overall pleasantness he brings to the classroom."

"One of my favorite professors at Asbury, Buhler makes learning philosophy so inspiring, challenging and exciting. He has encouraged me through class discussions and personal one-on-one time in the pursuit of a deeper understanding of wisdom, faith, maturity and (of course) humor. I would not be the same person I am today without his leadership."


## Bad

"Graded Unit Papers did not always have comments, but questions or concerns were always quickly responded to in emails or in class."(PHI305-002 2016)

"I did not appreciate the online quizzes because I felt that they were unnecessarily excessive and were worded confusingly. The online quizzes did not benefit me in anyway."(PHI305-002 2016)

"The midterm study guide questions were MUCH different than what was on the midterm exam, this posed a challenge when studying."(PHL200 2014)

"The course also required a lot of reading, which needed to be read fairly quickly. It would have been helpful to have dropped a book or a few less necessary lectures in order to offer more time to finish the readings." (PHL200 2014)

"Was very slow at responding to emails."

"I wish he had been almost less respectful of our thoughts. I felt like we wasted so much time in class that we could have spent listening to Buhler lecture because he is brilliant and then commenting on the lecture and readings that we have come to class already understanding rather than stumbling through reading them together in class."(PHL293 2016)

## Ugly (because drama is fun)

"Suggestions for improvement of this course: - Actually teach a class not just have a discussion with a very vague outline."(PHL200 2014)


"This course was, to be quite honest, a waste of my time. Students do not have a strong enough foundation in philosophy and critical thinking to have intelligent discussions about the material. This course is one that I will forget everything I learned by the time I've finished the final."(PHL200 2014)

Very funny and tried to crack a lot of jokes. Also, full of energy for an 8AM.(PHL200 2016)
