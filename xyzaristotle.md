## "Said of a Subject" ##

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## "In a Subject" ##

> I call "in a subject" what is in something, not as a part, and
> cannot exist separately from what it is in.
> (1a)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

> Some are neither in a subject not said of a subject, for example
> the individual man or the individual horse.
> (1b)

## Substance ##

(οὐσία)

What is most fundamental?

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Primary vs. Secondary Substance ##

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Substance vs. Quality ##

</section>
<section data-markdown>

> Said by itself, each of the things mentioned above is no
> assertion, but, in combination with others of these, it becomes
> an assertion.  For it seems that every assertion is either true
> or false;
> (9b--10a)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Definition ##

</section>
<section data-markdown>

> It is because they are subjects for everything else that primary
> substances are most properly called substances.
> (3a)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

> Each substance seems to signify a particular THIS.  As far as
> primary substances are concerned, it is indisputable true that
> each signifies a particular THIS, for what is indicated is
> individual and one in number.
> (10a)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

> As far as secondary substances are concerned, it seems from the
> appearance of the name when one says "man" or "animal" that they,
> too, signify a particular THIS.  But it is not really so.
> Rather, each signifies a particular SORT.
> (10a)

# On The Heavens #

</section>

## Circular Motion ##

1. Simplicity
2. Nature
3. Completeness

</section>
<section data-markdown>

> From all these premises therefore it clearly follows that there
> exists some physical substance besides the four in our sublunary
> world, and moreover that it is more divine than, and prior to,
> all these.
> (269a)

<section data-markdown>

## Elements ##

1. Finite
2. Not Eternal

# Metaphysics IV #

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## First Philosophy ##

> There is a science that studies being in so far as it is being,
> and also the properties of being in its own right.  It is not the
> same as any of the so called special sciences.  For none of them
> considers being quite generally, in so far as it is being.
> (933a)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Pros Hen Predication ##

> Similarly, then, being is spoken of in many ways, but in all
> cases it is spoken of with reference to one principle.
> (1003b)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

> Being and unity are the same and a single nature, since they
> imply each other.
> (1003b)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Philosophy vs. Geometry ##

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## The Firmest Principle of All ##

> It is impossible for the same thing both to belong and not belong
> at the same time to the same thing and in the same respect.
> (1005b)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

# Metaphysics VII #

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## What is Substance? ##

- Form?
- Matter?
- Composite?

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Form ##

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Matter ##

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Composite ##

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Essence ##

(the-what-it-was-to-be)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

> Now, a composite is composed of something in such a way that the
> whole thing is one, not as a heap is, but as a syllable is.  A
> syllable is not the same as its letters---for instance, B and A
> are not the same thing as BA.
> (1041b)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

> Now this is the substance of a given thing; for this is the
> primary cause of the thing's being [what it is].  Some things are
> not substance, but the things that are substances are naturally
> constituted; hence this nature---the one that is not an element
> but a principle---will apparently be substance.
> (1041b)

# Metaphysics XII #

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Prime Mover ##

> And since whatever both is moved and initiates motion is an
> intermediary, there is something that initiated motion without
> being moved, something that is everlasting and a substance and
> actuality.
> (1072a)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Pure Actuality ##

> But since there is something that initiates motion without itself
> being moved, and this is actually operating, it cannot be
> otherwise in any respect at all.
> (1072b)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Pure Understanding ##

> Understanding in its own right is of what is best in its own
> right, and the highest degree of understanding is of what is best
> to the highest degree in its own right.  And understanding
> understands itself by sharing the character of the object of
> understanding.
> (1072b)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Pure Life ##

> Further, life belongs to the god.  For the actuality of
> understanding is life, and the god is that actuality.
> (1072b)

</section>
<section data-markdown>

## Narcissistic? ##

> [The divine understanding], then, must understand itself, so that
> its understanding is an understanding of understanding.
> (1074b)
