**Office Hours:** Tues/Thurs, 12-1pm @ Kinlaw by C. S. Lewis.


## Course Description: 
This class is an exercise in a different way of thinking. We will think deeply about the world, God, death, science, logic, language, and our own selves. Along the way, we will learn some facts of history, vocabulary words, philosophical concepts, and big names. But our main task is to *think*.  You may be confused. You will be challenged. 

We will think by discussing, reading, and writing. For thinking clearly, logically, accurately is the master skill. It is useful for academics, for work, and for life. For some, this class will convince you to major or minor in philosophy. For others, it will make you better in your own discipline. For you must think well in any profession: No matter the career, the top five most coveted job skills are communication, teamwork, critical thinking, and creativity, and self-discipline, which philosophy can help you with.

For still others, thinking well will help you in motherhood or the monastery. For all of us, we want to become more connected, integrated, thoughtful, reflective human beings.  The ultimate motivation for having the conversation we call philosophy must be that it can make us better. We are also entering into the Great Conversation with our own, limited (often confused) thoughts, becoming part of the Conversation, and (by it) being forever changed. 

**Our goals then are:**

* To become familiar with the thought of major philosophers such as Plato, Augustine, Hume, and others. 
* To understand major philosophical questions, figures, and theories such as platonism, Augustinianism, and empiricism.
* To read, comprehend, and criticize difficult philosophical arguments.
* To use analytical and abstract thinking skills to evaluate arguments and philosophical theories.
* To understand the Christian answers to questions about the meaning of life, the structure of the cosmos, the possibility of scientific knowledge, and the ground of morality.
* To understand the Christian faith contrasted with metaphysical naturalism, nihilism, and deism.
* To practice reflect thinking upon our own lives, beliefs, attitudes, culture, and goals.
* To become more thoughtful, alert human beings, in pursuit of goodness, truth, and beauty.

##Scope and Sequence:
To accomplish these goals, we will work through 10 Units. Each 2 week Unit consists of (1) readings and quizzes, (2) participation through talking and writing, (3) and a disputation paper. There is a midterm and final exam.

## Grading:
You will be graded equally on each component, plus applicable extra credit.

|  Assessment category  |  Percent of semester grade |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Readings (Quiz/reports) |         20%   |  
| Participation (Talking, writing) |   25% |
| Tests (Midterm, Final)         |  25% |
| Disputation Papers (6 papers, pass/fail) |  25% |
| Extra Credit | 3% (max)|

I typically do not round up. So 89.5 is a “B”

-----------------------|---------------
A  = 99%-94% |       A- = 90%-93%   
B+ = 87%-89%   |   B  = 84% - 86%         
B-  = 80% - 83% |   C+ = 77%-79%
C   = 74% - 76%  |   C-  = 70% -73%
D  = 69% - 60%   |  F  < 59%

The primary work if this class will be reading — and trying to understand — these books. I am requiring real books. This is harder but more interesting than a textbook. You’ll be reading about 3 hours a week. Read well. Read every assignment entirely. Skimming is sometimes necessary, but don’t skim every week. 


### Quizzes
A short reading quiz is due almost every class day. These assess whether you read, and how well. They are mandatory and graded. You have 10 minutes for each quiz, and they are due at the beginning of class. 

### Reading Tips
* Read ahead. 
* Give yourself enough time to read carefully. You will get better and faster. 
* *Try to understand* the book. What is the author’s key terms? The author’s main point? 
* Dialogue with the book before class. Take notes. Email me. Talk with each other. Talk with other friends. Process your thoughts. 
* Take notes on: Is the author correct? What confused you? What questions did you have? What does the book mean?
* The two most important questions for each reading 1. What is the main truth claim? 2. What is the evidence?
* Pay attention to what confuses you and what you disagree with. Bring your questions to class.
* Don’t read the introduction for the book (which is often more confusing than the book). If you do want to read it, read it after reading the primary source — that may help. 
* Use things like Sparknotes sparingly. I want you to have your own encounter with the text. Get your own first impression. Sparknotes can pretty useful but don’t rely on it and only read it after reading the primary source.

##Attendance:
We need you here! Attendance is mandatory. Roll will be taken each class. (Being repeatedly or egregiously late will count as an absence.) 1 to 6 unexcused absences are freebies — no credit lost. 7 or more unexcused absences cause bigger and bigger deductions from your participation grade. (8 is a letter grade) You are paying for this education including this class, so why wouldn’t you make the most of it?  


##Participation through dialogue/writing:

This is a dialogue-oriented class. Every person is responsible to participate. 

*Speaking Emphasis:* "External processors" emphasize talking. You will be on my “go to” team to talk in class (instead of posting reflections after class).  

*Writing Emphasis:* "Internal procesors" emphasize writing.  to earn participation points, you will post class reflections online every week. You may elect to speak in class as well, and may be called upon.

Everyone starts at an 80% for the discussion grade; you can move up from there or down, depending on whether you speak or write once per week, pay attention, and offer helpful contributions.

Come *prepared*. Read, take notes, reflect, and come ready to share your viewpoint, defend it, listen to others' viewpoints, and critique theirs. 

A discussion is more than just sharing opinions; it is a friendly, eager, sincere search for truth. We can't judge each other, but we must judge each other's opinions, and test them for truth. We discuss because it is more interesting; it helps us retain the information; it challenges our own viewpoint; and because philosophy itself is a dialogue. Discussion ground rules are posted online. 


## Tests: 
There are two exams: midterm and final. These exams will assess your knowledge of historical facts, philosophical definitions, and the ability to synthesize and apply concepts. The Study Guide is posted online.

## Philosophical Disputation Papers: 
Every 2 weeks or so, you will write a 400+ word disputation. Each disputation is pass/fail and worth approximately 4% of the semester grade. The instructions are posted online.

## Extra Credit?
For those who may need or desire to do extra credit, there are three opportunities for extra credit. Instructions are posted online. 

## Miscellany
1. Bring the book for the day (on paper or computer), a pen or pencil, to every class.
2. Participate. Participation is your responsibility; I may or may not call on you. Do not distract yourself with side conversations, texting, Facebook, or doing anything else in class. A short mental break every once in a while when you get tired is fine. But come back. 
3. Be respectful. This means paying attention in class to the instructor and your fellow classmates. If you have an important phone call or text, please step outside the class for a moment and return. Show others respect and you will be respected in turn. Listen attentively, don’t make side conversation or say excessive frivolous comments.  Be polite in your emails to me and in your comments to your fellow students. Unkindness, even in the form of jokes and teasing, will not be tolerated. Come to class on time, but don’t leave (nor pack up) before we’re done.  
4. Don’t use electronics. If you ask for permission, I will allow you to use Laptops/iPads on lecture days for note taking. If you need to take a phone call or text, please step outside the room for a moment and come right back.  Otherwise, no phones, laptops, iPhones, or iPads, iPods, smartphones, etc. Unplug, listen and engage.  
5. Communicate. Email me anytime but only between 8am-5pm Monday – Friday, or as I’m available. Include your full name and section number (I teach two sections, so I want to get your identity straight). I’ll try to respond within two business days.   Take advantage of office hours. Call, tweet, or Google Hang Out during office hours or by appointment for any question, big or small, about this course. For short, quick questions, try sending me a direct message on Twitter.  
6. I can accommodate you: If you have a documented disability that might require academic accommodation, please make sure you are registered with the Academic Support Program. Contact Pam Downing (pamela.downing@asbury.edu / (859) 858-3511 x2283.
7. Make up work is not accepted after the due date. It must be submitted within a week of an excused absence, with written consent. Let me know if you are going to be absent for any reason.
9. Enjoy philosophy. We are not merely solving abstract puzzles here, but digging deeply into human thinking in a way that could change your life forever. The more you and your fellows allow yourselves to acquire a “taste” for the material, the more inclined you will be to give it the real effort required to master it.

8. Don’t cheat. Cheating or plagiarism will result in a zero for the assignment. Cite your sources. Unintentional plagiarism is still plagiarism. Egregious instances or repeat instances will result in formal disciplinary action from the university. Also, do not intentionally take anyone else’s work nor provide your work to anyone else (under whatever auspices). Academic integrity, the embodiment of the moral and spiritual principles to which we adhere, is the essential basis of the Asbury University academic community. Integrity, as partially defined by the Student or Program Handbook on Community Life Expectations, is “both knowing the right thing to do and doing it regardless of the circumstances.” This definition may be applied to all of the scholastic interactions of the academic community. Every member of the community shares responsibility for maintaining mutual trust, respect, and integrity. Violations of such trust and specific acts of academic dishonesty will be subject to disciplinary action.
- Academic dishonesty can be defined as any type of cheating relative to a formal academic requirement. Academic dishonesty is typically thought of first as plagiarism. Plagiarism, whether intentionally or unintentionally, occurs when credit is taken for what someone else worked hard to discover and record if there is no clarification from where or from whom information is taken. Plagiarism is the use of another’s ideas, words, thoughts, or organization without appropriate credit and documentation when used for a project, paper, presentation, or exam.
- More examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to: unauthorized collaborations, fabrications of data, unauthorized access to sources on an exam, excessive revision by someone other than the student, re-use of previous work without permission, and other situations described by faculty for specific purposes.
- Faculty will address suspected occurrences of academic dishonesty as follows:
- The faculty member will meet with the student individually to discuss the incident. At the faculty member’s discretion, the department chair will either be notified of the meeting or be asked to be present for it. The student will be informed of the department chair’s involvement. At the faculty member’s discretion the student will receive a lowered grade, an F or 0% on the assignment in question. The faculty member will report the incident in writing to the Registrar who will maintain a record of academic integrity violations.If the incident is the student’s second offense of academic dishonesty as verified by the Registrar, the student will meet with the Dean of the college or school where the most recent incident occurred. At the Dean’s discretion, the student will receive an F in the course. If the incident is the student’s third offense, the student will be suspended from Asbury University. 
- Students desiring to appeal a determination of academic dishonesty will follow the ‘Academic Appeals Procedure’ found in the Probation, Suspension, and Appeals section of the Asbury University Bulletin, specifically item 1. A.
