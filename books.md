>"Like the dialectic in real life, the discussion Buhler begins in 'Sola' does not end with the final page. He uses the written word as a way to encourage and direct readers who find themselves in aporia... By pointing to those bigger questions, Buhler invites the freader into the drama of the dialectic--of inquiring, analyzing, arguing, and hopefully falling more in love with Truth."

>"This is a marvelous book. I highly recommend it... definitely will re-read."

>"This book is unlike any book I've ever read before (except for maybe Plato's writings)."

>"Buhler writes with Socratic humility."
