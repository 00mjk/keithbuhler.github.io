### Course Description: 

Everyone thinks and makes decisions every day. However, we all make mistakes. Some mistakes are easy to avoid, but others are much more difficult to avoid. Critical thinking is a set of skills that help one to avoid errors in thinking and in life. For example, it includes the skill of noticing why you believe what you believe and why others believe what they do; and of examining the evidence for or against a belief, including assessing the sources of information or evidence you use. 

This course is designed to give you a lot of practice in thinking critically about a variety of topics. You will learn new concepts from logic, science, statistics, and rhetoric while putting them to use in analyzing arguments and making your own.


### Course Goals: 

* To become familiar key terms such as argument, validity, conclusion, and premise
* To critically analyze arguments from advertising, politics, philosophy, literature, and everyday conversation 
* To learn to ask good questions about our own lives, our decisions, our beliefs, our goals, and our sources of information or evidence
* To compare and contrast the evidence for a variety of current controversies

### Grading: 

The class work consists of four components: reading, participating, and writing. You will be graded on each component.

Reading                 25%   
Participation           25%   
Quarter Tests           25%  
Final Exam              25%     

I typically do not round up. So 89.5 is a “B”

-----------------------|---------------
A  = 99%-94% |       A- = 90%-93%   
B+ = 87%-89%   |   B  = 84% - 86%         
B-  = 80% - 83% |   C+ = 77%-79%
C   = 74% - 76%  |   C-  = 70% -73%
D  = 69% - 60%   |  F  < 59%  


### Reading

The primary work if this class will be to do the readings, exercises, and participate in class. Think critically as you read -- that's why we're here!

### Quizzes
Short reading quizzes will be posted online. They are due before class and assess whether you finished the reading. 

### Attendance:
We need you here! Attendance is mandatory. Roll will be taken each class. (Being repeatedly or egregiously late will count as an absence.) 1 to 3 unexcused absences are freebies — no credit lost. 4 or more unexcused absences cause bigger and bigger deductions from your participation grade. (6 is a letter grade) You are paying for this education including this class, so why wouldn’t you make the most of it?  

### Participation

This is a dialogue-oriented class. Every person is responsible to participate. Some may wish to prepare comments to share in class while others may wish to write in the online forum. Either way, a discussion is more than just sharing opinions; it is a friendly, eager, sincere search for truth. We can't judge each other, but we must judge each other's opinions, and test them for truth. We discuss because it is more interesting; it helps us retain the information; it challenges our own viewpoint.

### Quarter Tests

There are tests at about the first month and third month. These will assess your mastery of key concepts and your ability to put critical thinking skills into action. The study guides will be posted online. 

### Final Exam

The final exam is cumulative. It will consist of nearly 100 questions, including multiple choice, true/false, and possibly short answer or essay questions from each of our core topics. The study guide will be posted online. 



### Miscellany
1. **Bring your** textbook every day. 
2. **Participate**. Challenge yourself to talk. Taking short "mental breaks" is fine, but come back. 
3. **No smartphones.** If you need to take a text message or phone call, step out, respond, and come back. 
3. **Laptop/tablet users must sit in the front row.**
3. **Be respectful of others**: no teasing, and pay attention when a neighbor is talking. Don't pack up early. Don't come late. Don't talk while your neighbor is talking.
5. **Contact me.** Best method is to chat after class. I read every email but may not respond to every email. If I don’t respond within three (3) business days, email again with the subject “nudge”.
6. For short, quick questions, use Twitter (@keith_buhler)
6. **I can accommodate you**: If you have a documented disability that might require academic accommodation, please make sure you are registered with the Academic Support Program. Contact Pam Downing (pamela.downing@asbury.edu / (859) 858-3511 x2283.
7. **Make up work** is not accepted after the due date. It must be submitted within a week of an excused absence, with written consent. Let me know if you are going to be absent for any reason.
9. **Enjoy philosophy**. We are not merely solving abstract puzzles here, but digging deeply into human thinking in a way that could change your life forever. The more you and your fellows allow yourselves to acquire a “taste” for the material, the more inclined you will be to give it the real effort required to master it. 
8. **Plagiarism**. Even unintentional plagiarism earns a zero for the assignment and, in intentional or egregious cases, failing the course and receiving a permanent mark on your academic record. You’ll submit your papers to SafeAssign on Blackboard to help avoid accidental plagiarism. Don’t even think about stealing someone else’s thought/work.
