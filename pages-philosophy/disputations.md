Disputations prove a thesis. The thesis answers a question. Disputations respectfully summarize your opponent's viewpoint. Disputations state a thesis, provide good arguments, state reasonable objections, and refute them. Disputations are not papers,  since they don't have an  introduction or conclusion. Disputations are the outline or "skeleton" of a paper, with clear, numbered, sections. 

Here is an example disputation for us to discuss: 

**Are McDonald's chicken nuggets made of chicken meat?**

1. **Objection 1**. It seems that McDonald's "chicken" nuggets are not made of meat. For they do not have the right texture, like a chicken breast or chicken wing. 
3. **Objection 2**. Furthermore, there is a picture of "pink goo" on the internet showing what McNuggets look like before they are molded and cooked. 
4. **Appeal to authority**. On the other hand, CNBC reporter Landon Dowdy says that "it's just chicken." 
5. **Argument**. I answer that McNuggets are made of ground chicken meat. Mythbusters host Grant Imahara did a report inside the Tyson factory and took video footage showing that the nuggets are made from whole chickens, cut up, ground, flavored, and pressed into molds.[^3] Although industrially produced ground chicken may be unappetizing before it is breaded and fried, it is indeed chicken meat. The final product is so heavily salted and preserved, that it may not be healthy, but it is still meat. 
6. **Reply to objection 1**. The texture of McNuggets is to chicken breast as the texture of ground beef chuck is to steak. The meat is processed and ground and then fried, but it is still meat. 
6. **Reply to objection 2**. The picture passed around on social media sites is not of chicken meat, but a picture of boneless lean beef trimmings used to make bolognas, sausages, and so on.[^4]

This example shows several key points. Let's consider them. 

A passing Disputation is in four-point format: 

**Question**. This is your title. It is a question with two alternatives, basically a yes/no question. 

1. **Objections**. These succinctly state objections to your thesis. These summarize your opponent's answer to the question. You will eventually refute the objection below. For now, just state it as sympathetically as you can. You may have one to three objections. Avoid having more than three.
2. **Authority**. This section quotes an authority who agrees with your thesis. Actually cite them, word for word. Use Plato, Socrates, Scripture, science, or anyone whom you consider to be an authority. 
3. **Argument**. This section actually argues for your thesis. Begin by stating your thesis. The thesis is a truth claim. It is the governing principle of the whole essay. Each paper should have only one thesis, and every word, every sentence, and every paragraph should relate to the thesis. Then, provide support for your thesis. Why should we think your thesis is true? The evidence for a thesis may be: factual, logical,  statistical, anecdotal, intuitive, and so on.  But the arguments must be strong and support the thesis. The argument is the heart of the paper. This is where you attempt to provide sound, solid reasoning why anyone should think your thesis is true. You should aim for at least two or three different arguments in defense of your conclusion. Define your terms. Each argument uses one or a few key terms. Make sure your sentences are clear and exact. And finally, make sure that your argument form is valid. Make sure your premises are true (or very likely). You can use evidence from your own research, the text, or your own thinking.  
4. **Reply to objections.** Your last paragraph(s) deals with your counterclaim. How can you refute your opponent’s counter argument? You must either refute their evidence or acknowledge but re-interpret it to show that it does not damage your conclusion. 


A PASSING DISPUTATION achieves seven goals: 

1. **Answer the question.** The questions are provided. Your disputation presents and proves an answer to the question. 
2. **Argue your thesis.** Do not say "I believe" or "I feel that". State your thesis and support it with arguments and evidence. 
3. **State reasonable objections.** Do not just argue your view, summarize your opponent's view. Do not demonize or mock your opponent. Even though they are mistaken, assume they are making a reasonable, understandible, intelligent mistake. You are going to argue against yourself before you argue for yourself. The point is to make sure you know what your opponents think and why. Do not demonize or mock your opponent. They may disagree with you, they may be wrong, but do not assume that they are stupid. Rather, use the principle of charity: assume they have some good reason to disagree with your thesis (even if it’s not good enough!) Cite texts from our semester, or use other logical or anecdotal evidence to give some support to the counterclaim. You can use arguments from the texts, from your research, or from your own thinking. 
4. **Appeal to authority**. The "On the other hand" section is the transition from the Objections to your argument. This is where you use an authority that you think gets it right as a starting point in building your case. If you can’t find an authority who agrees with you, that doesn’t necessarily mean you are wrong, but it is a bad sign. You can use an authority from the text, from history, your own research, or you can do without it (but I don’t recommend doing without it — that places you as the authority. And are you really an authority on this stuff yet?). 
4. **Refute objections**. Do not just state your opponent's view, but explain why it is wrong. You can re-interpret their objection, refute it, clarify it, but don't ignore it. 
5. **Meet the length requirement.**Except for the first paper, the length requirement is 400 word minimum, 1000 max. This minimum excludes block quotes, headings, title, name, page numbers etc. 
6. **Cite the text**. Each disputation should interact with the relevant semester text. Cite correctly using MLA, APA, Turabian, or Chicago formatting -- just be consistent. (I prefer Chicago or MLA but do what you like.) Cite our text books, the Bible, journal articles, etc., but never cite Wikipedia or dictionaries, since these reflect general knowledge and are sometimes inaccurate or irrelevant.
7. **Write clearly and simply**. Be frank and to the point. Don't use B.S. or filler. Just say your point, make your arguments, and move on. 

A failing disputation commits one or more of the following errors: 

1. Doesn't answer the assigned question; answers a different question or no question at all.
2. Doesn't provide arguments but only asserts, opines, shares its feelings. 
3. Doesn't state reasonable objections; demonizes or mocks opponent; asserts wild straw man objections that no one actually believes. 
4. Doesn't refute objections; leaves them hanging, or provides weak assertions to the contrary. 
5. Doesn't meet minimum length requirement; uses excessive block quotes to make up for low word count. 
6. Doesn't cite any texts; doesn't cite semester texts or any other research.
7. Is composed mostly of convulated, forced, obscure, "thesaurus heavy", pretenious, garbled, academic B. S. 

I recommend that you write the paper in your preferred text editor (like Word or Google Docs), save a copy, then copy/paste it into the browser by the due date. 

**Formatting tips:**

* 1 inch margins
* Double spaced
* Serif font such as Times New Roman or Baskerville
* Insert page numbers

# Topics Intro to Philosophy  (Spring 2017)

### Disputation, Unit 1. (Origins) Is Christian belief primarily supported by faith or by reason? 
Three core Christian beliefs are that God exists and created the world, that all men are sinful, and that Christ died and rose again for our salvation. JP Moreland argues that non-Christians (as well as anti-intellectual Christians) have a secular view of knowledge. Using one or more of these three doctrines as examples of “Christian belief”, summarize whether Christians accept this/these belief(s) because of faith or reason. Summarize in the “objections” section at least one reason to accept the opposite of your thesis. You are free to argue that these beliefs are supported by both faith and reason, but you must answer the question about which one is primary. 

### Disputation, Unit 2.  (Socrates) Does philosophical conversation (dialectic) harm or benefit children? 
Socrates is accused of “corrupting the young” probably because he engages them in philosophical conversation (dialectic). According to Kreeft, philosophical conversation is ignorant, poor, and foolish but also misunderstood, happy, pious, and death-defying. The dangers of philosophical conversation include that it might disobey the Fifth Commandment (honor thy father and mother), subvert irrational traditions, or just plain hurt your feelings. The opportunities of philosophical conversation include that it might obey the First Commandment (love God), strengthen rational traditions, and humble your mind. So, using Socrates Apology (and others) as an example, argue either that dialectic is harmful for the young or that it benefits the young.

### Disputation, Unit 3, (The Soul) Does the soul die with the body or live on?
Socrates provides three arguments (plus a fanciful story) to convince Simmias and Cebes that death is not the end: including what we label the "Argument from Opposites," the "Argument from Recollection," and the "Argument from Affinity (to Forms)”. Is the soul immortal? Summarize at least one argument from the text (either as an objection or argument) and argue for your answer to this question.
 
### Disputation, Unit 4, (Logic) Is all truth subjective or is some truth objective? 
Kreeft shows how traditional logic and language indicates that reality is real and independent of the thoughts and opinions of human beings. Nevertheless, truth is difficult to attain. People disagree. Opinions vary. There is no accounting for taste. Everyone agrees that some truths are subjective. Are all truths subjective? Or are some objective? Use Peter Kreeft (and possibly Plato, Moreland, etc) to argue 

### Disputation, Unit 5 (Augustine) Is evil a substance or merely a privation of goodness? 
One of Augustine's big concerns is evil and goodness. He calls the Christian God good from the very first page, and says he struggled with how to understand evil. Does it exist? Certainly some people are evil (satan, Stalin) and some deeds are evil (like Augustine’s stealing the pear) but is evil a substance or the privation of goodness?  Use Augustine’s arguments (especially Book VII) either in your arguments or objections, and argue your thesis answering this question. 

### Disputation, Unit 6 (Re-Write)
Choose one of your previous disputations, and make the following modifications. Remove the section headings ("Objection", "I argue", etc.); write a strong introduction and conclusion and introduction; add new arguments if and new citations if you find any; make any other improvements; triple-check for spelling errors and polish it. 

### Extra Credit Disputation Options (1000 minimum)

### Option A (Design your own) What is your question? 
You may design your own question. I must approve the question before you begin. Your question prompt is due a week in advance of the paper. You may draw your question from any of the semester texts, handouts, books, or films.  The question must: Be clear; Deeply interest you; Admit of a yes/no answer; Be rooted in one of our semester texts. 

### Option B (Moreland, Plato, Augustine, Sophie’s World) Does Platonism contradict Christianity?  (1000 word minimum)

Augustine was a Manichaean first, a Platonist second, and a traditional Christian third. He details why he thought each of these. Where do the teachings of "Platonism" differ from teachings of the historic Christian Church and where do they overlap? How does “Athens” relate to “Jerusalem”?  Does Platonism contradict Christianity? Does philosophy/science contradict theology? In your disputation, use Augustine’s arguments (especially Book VII) in either your argument or objections, and argue your answer to this question.

### Option C. (Films) Is man evolving into something superhuman or devolving into something subhuman? 

2001 A Space Odyssey and Wall-E present very different pictures of the relationship between man and technology. Is humanity essentially good, and becoming better? Essentially evil, and becoming worse? Essentially bad but becoming good? Essentially good but becoming bad? 

### Option D (Plato, Kreeft) Do forms exist in reality or only in our minds? Are they things and concepts or just concepts? 
Socrates argues that truly real objects he calls "forms" exist and are stable, eternal things that underly all this changing flux. However, forms are (in one sense) invisible... What is a form and why think they exist? Why think they don’t? Are the just “in the mind”? In your disputation, use Plato and Kreeft article to present your own answer to this question.

# Topics Introduction to Ethics

### Unit 1. (Nature of Morality) Is the moral law a law of nature or a social convention? 

If morality is not merely an illusion, then it is either a law of nature discovered by humans (like rules of mathematics or logic) or a convention created by humans (like the rules of spelling or and baseball). Pojman, Hobbes, and Kreeft argue that morality is *useful* for keeping society together, reducing suffering, and promoting flourishing. But Pojman seems to think morality is *merely* useful (and not real), where Kreeft argues that it is *both useful and real* -- or perhaps useful because it is real. Using examples from *Lord of the Flies* and others, argue for one of these two claims.
