###Course Description:
This course is an exercise in a different way of thinking: philosophical thinking. This class is not an "introduction" to philosophical thinking because everybody already thinks this way *sometimes*. Rather, this class is an *exercise*. We will do more such thinking, and do it better. The means to that end is reading the Greek philosophers. In order to think philosophically, we will practice  read, discuss, and write about these philosophers. The "topics" the Greeks will lead us to think about are eclectic: reality, the origin of the world, unhappiness, knowledge, the soul, and death. Some of these questions are more abstract, some are more practical -- all of them are windows into a reality beyond the day-to-day. There are no long lectures; every class period will consist of *dialogue* together. Philosophical thinking cannot be programed into you; you must take responsibility for dialogging in class and out of class. There are no easy answers. You will be confused, at points. And the answers we will find will only come after hard work. So enjoy the ride. Ask questions. Get frustrated. Doodle. Guess. Take risks. The ultimate motivation for having the conversation we call philosophy must be that it can make us better. We enter into the Great Conversation with our own, often confused, thoughts. We may learn to love God with our minds. We may become more connected, integrated, thoughtful, reflective human beings. We may become part of the Conversation, and by it be forever changed. 

**Goals:**

* To understand and evaluate difficult philosophical arguments.
* To become familiar with the thought of major Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle.
* To understand the Christian worldview
* To reflect on our own lives, thoughts, and actions
* To become more virtuous, thoughtful, and wise human beings in the pursuit of goodness, truth, and beauty.

### Scope and Sequence:

The course is broken into five units of about 4 weeks each. Each unit consists of four components: 

- Reading
- Quizzes
- Discussion in class
- Writing

Therefore, the best way to earn an 'A' is to read carefully, participate, study, and write.
