Any position or view can be 'neo-Aristotelian' if it is a view held by Aristotele or inspired by Aristotle. Since Aristotle was the first to construct a Theory of Everything, almost any view can be neo-Aristotelian. 

However, the term is applied more narrowly in a few different ways: 

1. Neo-Aristotelian psychology (social science) 
2. Neo-Aristotelian naturalism (metaethics)
3. Neo-Aristotelian virtue theory (ethics)



 Any updated variety of Aristotelianism, from the Middle Ages to the present; in particular, a strain of moral philosophy in the late 20th century that resuscitated "virtue ethics" and practical wisdom in opposition to the emphasis on moral rules and deontologism found in Kantianism.
