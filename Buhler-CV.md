### DISSERTATION ABSTRACT

*Becoming What We Are: Virtue and Practical Wisdom as Natural Ends in Recent Neo-Aristotelian Ethics*   

This dissertation defends and augments the ethical naturalism of Philippa Foot against that of John McDowell. Foot and McDowell are united in the affirmation that virtue is 'natural goodness' for human beings. They are also united in endorsing scientific naturalism.  Nevertheless, they are divided in their rival conceptions of 'nature.' I defend Foot's view of natural goodness by appealing to "generic propositions," a little-utilized feature of linguistic theory. Generic life forms and organic functions are just as scientifically respectable as other naturalistic concepts. Human beings are best understood as practical, rational primates. It follows that the ethical and rational norms defining a good human life are a subset of natural norms which can be known as such from an "external" scientific point of view as well as from an "internal" ethical point of view. 

I also articulate neo-Aristotelian accounts of virtue and practical reason according to which all practical, rational animals necessarily pursue the (perceived) good and avoid (perceived) evil in every action they undertake. In short, virtue and  practical wisdom are natural ends for human beings. Even on scientific naturalism, what we are partially determines what we are to become: since we are practical rational animals capable of reasoning, we ought to become practically wise, despite varying abilities and life circumstances. 

While the normative force of my view is clear, I secure its naturalistic credentials by examining three influential conceptions of 'nature.' I criticize McDowell's conception, and show how my view is consistent with either of the remaining two. I call my view "recursive naturalism," for practical reasoning, which is natural to human beings, is part of the natural world even though we reason about the world, ourselves, and our own reasoning.
