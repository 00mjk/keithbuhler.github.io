### DISSERTATION
**Title**: *Becoming What We Are: Virtue and Practical Wisdom as Natural Ends*   
**Committee:** David Bradshaw (Chair), Dan Breazeale, Stefan Bird-Pollan, Mark Kightlinger      
**Abstract:** Philippa Foot and John McDowell are united in the affirmation that virtue is 'natural goodness' for human beings. They are also united in endorsing scientific naturalism.  Nevertheless, they are divided in their rival conceptions of 'nature.' 

This dissertation defends and advances upon Foot's view of natural goodness by appealing to "generic propositions," a little-utilized feature of linguistic theory. Generic life forms and organic functions are just as scientifically respectable as other naturalistic concepts. Human beings are best understood as practical, rational primates. It follows that the ethical and rational norms defining a good human life are a subset of natural norms which can be known as such from an "external" scientific point of view as well as from an "internal" ethical point of view. 

I articulate neo-Aristotelian accounts of virtue and practical reason according to which all practical, rational animals necessarily pursue the (perceived) good and avoid (perceived) evil that is internal to their life form. In short, virtue and practical wisdom are natural ends for human beings. We are practical rational animals capable of reasoning, so we ought to become practically wise, despite varying abilities and life circumstances. The life of virtue is the life spent becoming what we are. 

While the normative force of my view is clear, I secure its naturalistic credentials by examining three influential conceptions of 'nature.' I criticize McDowell's conception, and show how my view is consistent with either of the remaining two. I call my view "recursive naturalism," for practical reasoning, which is natural to human beings, is part of the natural world even though we reason about the world, ourselves, and our own reasoning.
