#Chapter 0: Introduction

### Thesis

In this dissertation, I shall defend the thesis that: **virtues are excellent character traits that all human beings as practical reasoners need, for virtues partly constitute the realization of our natural human telos.** 

### The Questions

The main problem of the dissertation is this: What is virtue in relation to practical reason and to our human *telos*? That is a broad way of putting the problem. There are various ways to divide out a set of sub-problems. Below, I tackle the division of these labors into chapters. But my hope is, by the end, to solve the problem of the relation of virtue to practical reason and happiness. 

      // For instance, what is virtue and is it really “necessary”? (Is the pursuit of virtue categorically imperative?) What is practical reason and what is the relation between rationality and morality? (Can the irrational person be moral, or the immoral person rational?) Does humanity have one *telos*, many, or none?  (Does beliefs about the immortality of the soul make a difference to morality?) The three main parts of the thesis reflect attempts to answer some of these questions. The notion that virtues are excellent character traits all humans *need*; the notion that all human beings especially need practical wisdom, which is single name for the excellence (or excellences) of practical reason; and the notion that such character traits partly (but not fully) constitute the realization of our natural human telos. As I shall argue, virtues like courage and practical wisdom depend neither on relative cultural values nor a dogmatic conception of human nature. Rather, the virtuous person is truly admirable as an exemplary expression of human nature as it is not merely in our concepts and cultures but in itself. All of this, of course, needs clarification. 


### The Sources

In the course of clarifying and defending these claims, I shall be obliged to take a stance on several active and lively debates among ethicists about virtue, practical reason, and human *telos*. Fundamentally, my arguments defend a sort of neo-Aristotelian naturalism.  For this reason, I work out my arguments by presenting, comparing, and critiquing the ethical views of three of the most prominent and influential neo-Aristotelian virtue ethicists: Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre. 

### The Neo-Aristotelians 

I select my themes from the neo-Aristotelian virtue ethicists. In the next chapter, I shall explain and defend the neo-Aristotelian project in more detail. Here I should only like to introduce a list of who they are in general and who my main authors are. Who are they? Rosalind Hursthouse provides a list: Anscombe,[@anscombe1958; @anscombe1957intention] Geach,[@geach1977virtues and 1956] Foot,[@foot2001natural] McDowell,[@mcdowell1998mindvalue; @mcdowell1996mind] MacIntyre,[@macintyre1999dependent] Hursthouse,[@hursthouse1999] Nussbaum,[@nussbaum1995aristotle;  @nussbaum1988non; nussbaum1999virtue] Thompson.[@thompson1995representation] For my part, I add Annas[@annas2011intelligent] and Brown[@brown2008]. These neo-Aristotelians are a group of contemporary (mostly analytic) philosophers who have written on a set of ethical questions that, in my opinion, represent some of the most significant and interesting work being done in English speaking ethics. There are many other influential philosophers who will remain in the background of my discussions, despite being “big names” in virtue ethics from the last 100 years.^[They include @murdoch1998sovereignty; Bernard Williams; @swanton2003virtue; @slote1992morality; @bloomfield2003moral; Robert Adams, Gopal Sreenivasan, Rachana Kamtekar, Talbot Brewer, and R. Scott Smith. One could certainly construct a worthwhile project approaching all of (or a different sub-set of) these authors. Nevertheless, the smaller set of Neo-Aristotelians are my focus. Every project must cut off scope somewhere.] All of these writers (and their many followers and critics) have contributed to a remarkable movement in analytic ethics. While I do make an effort to engage or at least mention contributions from this broader set, I have limited my primary focus to MacIntyre, Foot, and McDowell. Not only does this limitation keep my scope realistic, but also it allows for a rich discussion of the illuminating comparisons and contrasts between their views.

### The Form

 Many books and articles have been written on MacIntyre, Foot, and McDowell's views of virtue, practical reason, and *telos* (understood very broadly as 'happiness', 'flourishing' or 'well being').^[@annas2011intelligent gives a concise and clear account of all three.] However, not enough has yet been do on the dynamic relation between the three concepts. 

These three concepts are, according to Hursthouse, likely to be misunderstood by modern philosophers.[@sepvirtue. “Three of virtue ethics' central concepts, virtue, practical wisdom and eudaimonia are often misunderstood. Once they are distinguished from related but distinct concepts peculiar to modern philosophy, various objections to virtue ethics can be better assessed.”] And together they constitute a formal schema that many have made central to their theories.^[For example, McDowell, Foot, and MacIntyre can be seen using this schema @mcdowell1979virtue and @mcdowell1980role; @foot2002virtues and @foot2001natural; @macintyre1984after and @macintyre1999dependent] One justification for the scheme comes from Alasdair MacIntyre in *After Virtue*. There, he argues persuasively that necessary conditions of an intelligible moral system include:  (a) a conception of human nature -- including human rationality -- as it is prior to deep self-reflection or moral effort; (b) a conception of some human *telos* or end we ought to realize; and (c) a conception of the qualities or actions that enable a human being to achieve his or her telos. Simply put, a moral theory needs a starting point, an ending point, and (in tandem with those two points) a set of appropriate  means that end. 

### The Centrality of Teleology

The plausible belief seems to be that one cannot leave for vacation without knowing (a) where that destination is, (b) where one is at the moment, and (c) the directions — on foot, by car, or plane, or boat or what have you —  to the destination. Similarly, any attempt to construct a moral theory without all three components (human telos, human nature as practical reasoners, and virtue) is bound to stultify. 

Arguably, the unifying concept of the schema, arguably, is not virtue but *telos*. If we can't even create a shopping list of groceries we "should" buy without a clear conception of the dinner to be cooked, then *a fortiori* strict moral rules and virtues without any notion of the kind of life that is to be lived are bound to degenerate into a kind of pointless legalism. If natural human telos in particular is central to the project of virtue ethics, it would seem that developing a plausible modern virtue ethical theory would require rehabilitating a notion of natural teleology in general. 

### The Challenge of Teleology

However, the desire to rehabilitate natural teleology may seem overly optimistic. The idea of teleology has been a major stumbling block for centuries. One the one hand, supernatural teleology is felt by some to be too religious; on the other hand, natural teleology is commonly supposed to be somehow debunked by modern science. Francis Bacon and others intentionally excised "final causation" from natural science since they feared that empirical and theoretical investigation into final causes “defiled philosophy”.^[Cf. Bacon, New Organon, Book I. XLVIII “Although the most general principles in nature ought to be held merely positive, as they are discovered, and cannot with truth be referred to a cause, nevertheless the human understanding being unable to rest still seeks something prior in the order of nature. And then it is that in struggling toward that which is further off it falls back upon that which is nearer at hand, namely, on final causes, which have relation clearly to the nature of man rather than to the nature of the universe; and from this source have strangely defiled philosophy.”] If teleological virtue ethics is somehow distinctive of pre-modern traditions, wouldn't virtue talk be simply outmoded? Wouldn't any attempt to revive such talk be antiquarian and nostalgic? Is there a third alternative to “religious” teleology and natural teleology? Or can one of these disjuncts be rehabilitated in order that teleology may serve its crucial purpose in ethics? 

I think that the sort of realism about natural teleology that is needed for a virtue ethics built on human nature is -- and can be shown to be -- perfectly respectable in our modern era. Natural final causation is no more mysterious or magical than biological life, or consciousness, or rationality. And the pursuit of virtues is no more obsolete than any other human activity, such as farming, or laughing, or studying astronomy. 

Nevertheless, the skeptical worries must be taken seriously and addressed in detail. Modernity is not the ancient world. Modern science, philosophy, and culture are not the same as their pre-modern counterparts. It is imperative that contemporary virtue ethicists pay due respect to what *has* changed. It is imperative that contemporary virtue ethicists clarify the relationship of their theories to modern science. 

### Suspending Judgment about God

For this project, I set to one side the possibility of supernatural teleology. I do not wish to deny the possibility nor to assume it at the outset. The first reason for suspending discussion of this possibility is simply considerations of space. The second reason is that there is no consensus among neo-Aristotelians regarding the supernatural; some are atheists, some theists, of which some are Christian, others a different sort of theist. Despite this variety, they hold a broad consensus about the possibility of *somehow* grounding an ethical theory in human nature.^[Historically, a survey of teleological realists would feature theists, atheists, humanists, pantheists, and so on.] The “somehow” is my goal in this project. Thirdly, the existence of natural ends, if it can be defended, does not *necessitate* but is *compatible with* the possibility of supernatural ends. It is possible that God is directing all natural affairs to his purposes, including guiding human beings by commands; it is possible that the entire orchestral cosmos is organized around God as the *arche* and *telos*, and that (to paraphrase St. Augustine) “our hearts are restless until they rest in him”. However, for this project, I wish to see how far one’s ethical outlook can go while suspending judgment. 


### Why it matters

Normative ethical theories purport to provide their adherents with direction on how to live. They describe or evaluate what to do and what not to do. They give reasons for what is worthwhile, what is perhaps neutral but a waste of time, and what is to be carefully avoided. 

Unfortunately, much of our modern ethics (with the possible exception of bioethics) has become so barren and impractical that it has lost sight of — let alone connection to — the day to day direction on how to live. Thankfully, a few vociferous critics (such as Elizabeth Anscombe) have shaken us out of our stupor. Bernard Williams has done as much as anyone to remind moral philosophers that questions of how to live are prior, and deeper, than questions of what is wrong. “Character ethics,” rather than mere “quandary ethics” is what is really needed in the vast majority of circumstances. That is not to say that moral quandaries are unimportant in life or unimportant in theory; quite the contrary, often times the moral quandary is the exceptional case that can provide a cutting counterexample to a nonsensical view. And moral dilemmas like those encountered in great works of fiction (*Othello*, *War and Peace*, *Gilead*) are real, if blessedly rare, occurrences in a normal human life. But for all this for ninety-nine parts of any given day I encounter very few temptations to do wrong; day by day and even hour by hour I encounter many competing or conflicting goods that seem worthwhile but cannot all be pursued. Check email or grade papers? Write more or spend more time with my kids? Pursue a teaching job in state or out of state? Invest in this friendship or spend much-needed time alone? A normative ethical theory, if it is not merely an abstract game of conceptual Jenga, ought to guide its adherent in reflecting upon such goods, weighing them in a cool and sober hour, and giving reasons for what to do. 

The first reason why this ethical discussion — why any ethical discussion — matters is, of course, that ethics is part of the business of living well. And living well is, perhaps by definition, the only thing worth doing. 

However, there are several more mundane and academic reasons this investigation is worthwhile.  For example, the ongoing debates in metaethics over moral naturalism concern whether and how far moral properties can be identified with natural properties. My thesis bears obvious relevance to these debates. 

Furthermore, although virtue ethics has made a recent comeback, virtue ethicists have not yet come to consensus on a definition of virtue let alone a definition of practical reason or eudaimonia. In my view, part of the cacophony is due to a failure to coordinate the two concepts in complete ethical system. 

Much to blame for the barrenness of a lot of modern ethical theorizing is our obsession with individual actions over whole lives. 

### Taking morality seriously 

Another recent thinker who has advanced a thesis with some similarities is Israeli philosopher David Enoch. David Enoch's persuasive argument is that any alternative to objectivist moral realism, whatever its merits, doesn't account for or allow us to take morality sufficiently seriously -- as seriously as we already do, or as seriously as we must do — especially for deliberation about what to do. Moral realism of the robust sort gains its plausibility from allowing or explaining why we take morality just so seriously -- as serious as life and death. 

I take these claims together to be an explanandum and explanans. There are many ways of trying to convince people to take morality less seriously, by showing it up, by exposing it, deflating it, showing what moral claims "really" amount to, and so on. Peter Railton claims that some people can take morality too seriously even though they are avowed subjectivists. He says: 

>Some may be drawn to, or repelled by, moral realism out of a sense that it is the view of ethics that best expresses high moral earnestness. Yet one can be serious about morality, even to a fault, without being a moral realist. Indeed, a possible objection to the sort of moral realism I will defend here is that it may not make morality serious enough. (Railton, “Moral Realism” 164)

An objection Enoch might make (or that I shall make in the same spirit) is that there are two kinds of earnestness. One is an earnestness in doing good. The other is an inevitable earnestness in caring about what we do when we deliberate. Enoch emphasizes the second. Railton’s non-reductive but naturalistic morality may account for the fact that people sincerely and eagerly care about doing right but it doesn’t account for the way we in fact deliberate. 

Enoch summarizes his moral realism in this way: 

>I believe that there are irreducibly normative truths and facts, facts such that we should care about our future well-being, that we should not humiliate other people, that we should not reason and form beliefs in ways we know to be unreliable. These are, of course, just examples: even if I am wrong about them, I believe there must be some examples of this sort, examples of normative (and indeed moral) truths that are irreducibly normative, truths that are perfectly objective, universal, absolute. They are independent of us, our desires and our (or anyone else’s) will. And our thinking and talking about them amounts not just to an expression of any practical attitudes, but to a representation of these normative truths and facts. These normative truths are truths that, when successful in our normative inquiries, we discover rather than create or construct. They are, in other words, just as respectable as empirical or mathematical truths (at least, that is, according to scientific and mathematical realists).[@?]


### Conclusion

As difficult as it is to consider seriously the project of restoring teleology, final causality, natural purposiveness to its proper place, it can be done. And in order to defend an account of virtue as partly constitutive of our natural human *telos*, it *must* be done. Philosophers in the Aristotelian tradition are uniquely situated to do so. That tradition promises the resources with which to construct an ethical system including all three elements of the schema while rehabilitating a form of natural teleology that is not only tenable in light of modern beliefs, but rationally commends itself in light of all we now know.^[For Aristotle himself, humans were rational animals with a particular psychology and set of potentialities, including the endowment of divine nous; our species-wide *telos* was happiness or eudaimonia. A life of virtuous activity was the means to eudaimonia, and detailed information about the virtues -- both moral and intellectual -- were knowable from tradition and ratified or modified by reflecting on the lives of virtuous Athenian citizens. For neo-Aristotelians some aspects of Aristotle's three-fold system are correct as is, some need revising and updating, while others need throwing out.] 



### Chapter Outline

In short, I shall defend my thesis by way of discussing the three mentioned themes in the recent neo-Aristotelians, especially MacIntyre, Foot, and McDowell. Some (though not all) of those defending a teleological conception of nature and ethics have been virtue ethicists. The argument will unfold in the following chapters.

* Chapter 0. The Project of the Neo-Aristotelian Ethical naturalism.
* Chapter 1. Virtues as traits humans need as practical reasoners.
* Chapter 2. Virtues as excellent character traits.
* Chapter 3. Virtue as excellence of practical reason. 
* Chapter 4. Virtues as partly constituting the realization of our natural human *telos*. 
* Chapter 5. Conclusion.** 

### Apologia

Virtue, practical reason, and *telos* are age-old themes. Treating them adequately is far too grand a task for one dissertation. As Glaucon said to Socrates, "The measure of listening to such discussions is the whole of life."[@plato Republic 450b.] Nevertheless, they are significant themes. My hope is that even an unworthy treatment of a worthy topic will attain some value.
