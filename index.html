  <h2>Hi, I'm Keith Buhler.</h2>
  <p>I'm a philosopher, educator, researcher, and writer.</p>

<p>I started teaching the "great books" about 15 years ago. Since then, I have had the privilege of teaching college, high school students, and adults. I currently guide students in philosophy and ethics at the <a href="https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226">University of Kentucky </a> and Asbury University. Folks tend to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771">really like my classes.</a></p> 
<p>My dissertation research examines the concepts of virtue and practical reason in Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Robert Adams. I'm also interested in <a href="https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler">metaphysics, philosophy of mind and imagination, and philosophy of religion..</a> </p>
<p>When time permits, I write <a href="/fiction">fiction</a>. I help others to <a href="http://www.readingintentionally.com">read intentionally.</a> </p>
<p>This website is the start of a bigger project. In the meantime, enjoy.</p>
