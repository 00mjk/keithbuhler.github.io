  <h1>Hi, I'm Keith Buhler.</h1>
  <p>I'm a philosopher, educator, researcher, and writer.</p>
  <img src="face.jpg" alt="Keith Buhler" style="width:204px;height:204px;" align="left">
 
<p>I started teaching the "great books" about 15 years ago. Since then, I have had the honor of  guiding college, high school students, and adults to pursue truth and wisdom. I currently teach philosophy and ethics at the <a href="https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226">University of Kentucky </a> and Asbury University. Students tend to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771">really like my classes.</a></p> 
<p>I am focusing dissertation research on the concepts of virtue and practical reason in Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Robert Adams. I'm also interested in metaphysics, philosophy of mind and imagination, and philosophy of religion.</p>
<p>When time permits, I write <a href="/fiction">fiction</a>. I help others to <a href="http://www.readingintentionally.com">read intentionally.</a> </p>
<p>This website is the start of a bigger project. In the meantime, enjoy.</p>
