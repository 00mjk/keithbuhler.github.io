## 1. The best moral action is one that maximizes "utility"

What is good in itself? What is an intrinsic good?

## 2. Utilitarianism is a theory of normative ethics, a theory of what to do. 


**Metaethics** asks higher-order questions about what moral terms like ‘good’ mean and why people morally disagree. 

**Applied ethics** tries to resolve difficult ethical questions using normative principles.

**Normative ethics** tries to figure out true principles. How should I live? How do I resolve moral dilemmas? 

* Example: Profitable fraud versus costly integrity? 
* Example: Follow my family tradition or break out and innovate? 

Utilitarians say: do whatever maximizes happiness.

## 2. Utilitarianism is a theory of normative ethics, a theory of what to do. 


Should marijuana use be made illegal?  Does it cause pleasure or pain? Does it maximize pleasure over pain? Consider: 
>Pros: Most commonly used illegal drug. (National Institute on Drug Abuse), feel high, have fun.
>Cons: Gateway drug, correlated with mental health problems, anxiety, sleep problems. 

Should rollercoasters be made illegal?  Do they cause pleasure or pain? Consider: 
>Pros: Rollercoasters are fun. 1 in 300 million chance of dying. 
>Cons: Galaxyland Amusement Park (West Edmonton Mall), Edmonton, Alberta, “Mindbender”, June 1986: The world’s largest triple-loop indoor roller coaster crashed when four bolts came loose, allowing a wheel assembly to fall off the roller coaster. Dozens suffered minor injuries, one person had his legs crushed in the accident and three people lost their lives.

## Utilitarianism was founded by Jeremy Bentham

* Jeremy Bentham published An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation in 1789. 

>“Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do… By the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever according to the tendency it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question: or, what is the same thing in other words to promote or to oppose that happiness. I say of every action whatsoever, and therefore not only of every action of a private individual, but of every measure of government.”

* The goal was fairness. To create a society with laws and norms that do not harm the majority while only benefitting the minority but benefit all or most.

##4. Utilitarianism was updated by John Stuart Mill.


* John Stuart Mill wrote Utilitarianism in 1861. 

> Quote: “It is quite compatible with the principle of utility to recognise the fact, that some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others. It would be absurd that while, in estimating all other things, quality is considered as well as quantity, the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on quantity alone.... There is no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect… a much higher value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation.... A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, an certainly accessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence… It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.” 

* The goal is to live a life of cultivated pleasure, balancing intellectual and physical satisfaction.
