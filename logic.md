# Arguing Well —- Logic 101

Every argument has two parts: the premises and the conclusion. Premises are statements that, if true, support your conclusion. The premises are made up of words or terms. And there is a mysterious move from the premises to the conclusion we call inference. 

A good argument has three properties: clear terms, true premises, and a valid inference.
So, a bad argument may have one or more of three properties: unclear terms, false premises, or an invalid inference.

1. **Terms**. Most terms (especially important ones) need definition. State the definition of your key terms (not all of them, just the crucial ones). Don’t cite the dictionary — the dictionary records how people use words (even incorrectly), not how they ought to be used correctly. Explain how you are using the term, and move on.

Premises. True premises are ones we know to be true or reasonably think are probably true. True beliefs originate from four main sources: experience, memory, testimony, and authority.  
Experience. 1st-person observation, experience, insight in the present;
Memory. 1st-person observation, experience, insight from the past;
Testimony. 2nd-person testimony of someone else’s experience (from a non-expert or non-authority);
Authority. 2nd-person testimony from an expert or authority. 
All other true beliefs are inferred validly from premises derived from one of these sources.
Validity. An argument where the premises necessarily entail the conclusion is called valid. If an inference is valid, then it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. 
Validity, in the technical sense, is not the same as truth. Some true arguments are invalid, and some false arguments are valid. 
For example, “all penguins have feathers; my dog has fur, therefore Greenland is an island” consists of all true statements, but the inference is invalid. Likewise, “If my grandmother is a duck, then she can fly. My grandmother is a duck. Therefore, she can fly,” is a valid inference, but the argument is false since the second premise is false (obviously). 

So to make a good argument, be careful that your terms are clear, your premises true, and your argument form is valid. There are many valid argument forms. 

A few common argument forms are: 
‘All X are Y.’                  All human beings will die. 
All Z are X,’                   Socrates is a human being.      
therefore all Z  are Y.’        Therefore, Socrates will die. 
(Called “Barbara”) 


‘No X are Y, all Z are X,       No pigs can fly. Babe is a pig.
therefore no Z are Y.’          Therefore Babe cannot fly. 
(Called “Celarent”) 


If X then Y.            If it rained today, then the game was cancelled. 
X.                              It rained today.  
Therefore Y.’                   Therefore, the game was cancelled.
(Called “Modus Ponens”) 

‘If X then Y.                   If a global nuclear war has occurred, 
   then the world would be a wasteland. 
Not Y.                          The world is not a wasteland. 
Therefore not X.’               So a global nuclear war has not occurred.
(“Called “Modus Tollens”)
