**The good of man is the end of political science.** Aristotle


## Political Categories

There are many ways of dividing up political ideologies, philosophies, and strategies. The one I prefer is monarchism to anarchism. 

Conservatives prefer order, progressives want disorder. Specifically, progressives want the opportunity, empty space, and "freedom" to self-create. Conservatives are realists. Conservatives are traditionalists. The traditional set of worldviews are very diverse but they hold something deep in common: they believe in reality, truth, science, logic, and facts. 

Progressives are nihilists who believe in nothing but act upon the unconditioned self-will. 

Nihilists reject truth, science, logic, and all facts except themselves. There is no truth, only deception and even (according to Nietszsche) self-deception. There is no scientific backing for inihilism, for even science is subverted and rendered malleable according to the will to power of the scientist or the popular apologist and priest who interprets the scientist's oracular (and mystical) prophesies.  There is ultimately no logic to nihilism; nihilism is not an argument but a worldless how. Nihilism is not a worldview but the contradiction of all worldviews. It is a scratching, clawing, and gnashing at WORLDVIEW. Nihilists reject facts because they do not like the way the world is and wish to destroy it and start anew.
