Science, Demarcation Problem, and Philosophy 

Keith Buhler, 2015

## Is Philosophy Science? 

### Introduction ###

There is a great deal of confusion about both philosophy (which is my field) and natural science. To know the history of science and the history of philosophy is to cease to be confused. 

This article attempts to examine history, clarify concepts, and define terms in such a way as to help professional academics and interested students understand. It attempts to make clear the traditional ways of dividing up human knowledge of all of reality. The punchy way of putting my thesis is that philosophy is science. 

I'm not being sarcastic, nor am I crazy (at least that's what the voices in my head keep telling me). But of course by putting the point like this I'm picking fights. So let me be quick to assure you I am not arguing that "philosophy is science" means something ridiculous like "professional philosophers are employed in biology departments" or "professional scientists spend all their time bloviating about the meaning of words" -- which are obviously false. 

Perhaps another way of putting my thesis is this: philosophy and science are the same thing. The only differences between science and philosophy are the differences between this branch of philosophy and that branch of philosophy, or this branch of science and that branch of science. 

Here's an attempt to articulate the full thesis: Even there are real differences between disciplines along distinctions of subject matter, method, and professional association, all disciplines (whether currently labelled 'science' or currently labeled 'philosophy' in U.S. colleges and encyclopedias) are identical with respect to seeking knowledge about reality, acquiring a stable body of knowledge about reality, maintaining that knowledge in a community of knowers, passing that knowledge to the next generation of knowers, and being subject to scrutiny and accountability by future knowers. 

Getting there requires a bit of re-thinking our classification system for knowledge. But the re-thinking is justifiable and (I think) justified. Resistance to it is rooted, ironically, in an anti-scientific and anti-philosophical dogma that divorces philosophy and science. Some people are so wedded to this dogma that my arguments will threaten their ideology and they will only respond with insults, "psychologizing", appeal to motives (like suggesting that I am insecure about my profession), mockery, and so on. 

For the scientifically-minded, you might find something of interest. Let's see if I can convince you.

## Objections

First let's consider some common objections. It seems that philosophy is not science, because...

* Science is empirical, philosophy is rationalistic. 
* Science is about nature, philosophy is about concepts. 
[Science conducts experiments, philosophy only conducts thought experiments.](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/philosophy-is-not-a-science/?_r=0)
* Science progresses, [philosophy doesn't progress](http://philpapers.org/archive/DIETIN); [it is circular or stagnant.](http://consc.net/papers/progress.pdf)
* Science deals with the nature of the universe (a la Aristotle's Physics); philosophy deals with the nature of causation (a la Aristotle's Metaphysics). [link](http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/is-philosophy-a-science/45795)
* Science is divided into physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, economics, and so on; philosophy is divided into metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of mind, and so on. These are separate domains. 
* Science has nothing to do with religion or gods; philosophy overlaps with religious questions like the existence of God, the "true nature of reality", what existed before time and space and what will exist after the heat death of the universe. 
* Scientific methods involve testable, confirmable hypotheses; philosophical methods involve abstract, untestable, unconfirmable hypotheses.
Professional scientists do not call themselves philosophers; professional philosophers do not call themselves scientists. 
* Science departments are not in the same building as university philosophy departments.
* Scientific hypotheses are either empirically testable or meaningless. 
* J. L. Mackie argues that ethics and theology are both meaningless for the same reason: they are not empirical. 
* But Wikipedia says they are different.
* Science achieves consensus, or increasing convergance on truth; philosophy does not achieve such consensus. 


## Philosophy and science are the same thing.

On the other hand, Sam Harris argues that "There is no clear border between philosophy and science."[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnJ4S2l0nIs)  Science is  "science" means "knowledge" and "philosophy" means "love of wisdom", and "wisdom" and "knowledge" are nearly identical concepts. I argue that philosophy is science, and science is philosophy. There are distinctions among knowledge; there are distinctions between different kinds of knowledge, different subject matters, and different methods for acquiring knowledge. But all these distinctions apply across physics, metaphysics, biology, ethics, logic, cosmology, theology, etc. 

"Science" is ambiguous: it usually means one of three thins. (1) It can mean "knowledge," the content, the ideal encyclopedia of all truths; (2) it can mean "reality", the objects in the world and in ourselves that we want to know about; and (3) it can mean "method", the process by which we acquire new truths about reality. 

Every method that works to gain knowledge, every truth, and every real entity that can be known is "science" in one of these senses. Peter Singer says "Any serious study of a phenomenon" is scientific. He continues: the "broader view of science [includes everything] from genetics to economics... the German term wissenschafte includes philosophy and ethics... Not just [natural] science but careful thought and careful reflection..."

Ironically, most die-hard defenders of a distinction between science and philosophy are not scientists but philosophers who ascribe to a particular ideology: scientism. They simply have not reflected upon the demarcation problem and are ignorant of the history of metaphysics, physics, astronomy, and ethics. 

### The "demarcation problem", or "science is not even scientific"

The demarcation problem is the challenge of coherently distinguishing between science and non-scientific knowledge (like philosophy, art, and poetry) or non-knowledge (so called "pseudoscience", mythology, and falsehood). A solution would underwrite our intuitive or sociologically entrenched belief that, say, humanities are not sciences, but that astrology is not even a humanities discipline. This paper argues two claims: that the demarcation problem has no solution; and the only useful, and demonstrably reasonable demarcation is between 'scientia' (knowledge) and not-knowledge; that is, between true and fals.e 

First, I propose that the demarcation problem has no solution. That is, coherently to deny that (say) philosophy and ethics are sciences requires denying that formal disciplines such as mathematics, logic, statistics, information theory, systems theory, and linguistics are sciences; but coherently to admit that philosophy is a science requires admitting that other humanistic disciplines such as art, psychology, psychotherapy, literature, and poetry are sciences. One must pick one or the other of these unappealing conclusions.

Second, I attempt to address this question: if philosophy is a science, which science is it? I contend that it is "conceptual science". That is, most sciences are named by their *objects* of study -- physics studies the physical, biology studies the living, geometry studies spatial measurement, etc. Philosophers "study" concepts and the beings those concepts answer to. Hence, conceptual scientists owe a debt to each particular science and each particular scientist is also, partially, a conceptual scientist. 

### Hurray for science

I am pro science. I love science. I trust that scientific methods are the best means of garnering scientific knowledge of scientific facts. I love astronomy, technology, evolutionary biology, comparative anatomy, paleontology. I think tardigrades are cooler than tachyons, but both are cool. I think the deliverances of the various sciences are stable but also imperfect and always improving — the methods of science are the best (or only) ways of improving the established body of scientific knowledge. I think the truths science discovers are truths about the world. 

But what demarcates science from non-science? Exactly what demarcates truth from falsehood. Nothing else. That is, scientific methods are whatever methods — material or formal — that deliver true conclusions. The body of scientific knowledge is the body of true conclusions. Non-science is whatever is not true or whatever methods don’t result in true conclusions. 

So, for example, some sciences are biology, physics, chemistry, sociology, history, metaphysics, ethics, and theology. Some other sciences are cosmology, logic, archeology, comparative anatomy, anesthesiology, psychology. Some of the people who do biology, physics, chemistry etc. make false statements. This does not mean that their field is not longer, broadly speaking, a science, a body of knowledge. Some of the people who do archeology, psychology, and math make false statements. Likewise, their field is still a science.  

## "Philosophy is the queen of sciences", or "not even philosophy is philosophy"

We can take the point from a different angle by examining the history of philosophy. To quote Wikipedia: 
 
>Natural philosophy or the philosophy of nature (from Latin philosophia naturalis) was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science. It is considered to be the precursor of natural sciences.
From the ancient world, starting with Aristotle, to the 19th century, the term "natural philosophy" was the common term used to describe the practice of studying nature. It was in the 19th century that the concept of "science" received its modern shape with new titles emerging such as "biology" and "biologist", "physics" and "physicist" among other technical fields and titles; institutions and communities were founded, and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred.[1] Isaac Newton's book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687), whose title translates to "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", reflects the then-current use of the words "natural philosophy", akin to "systematic study of nature". Even in the 19th century, a treatise by Lord Kelvin and Peter Guthrie Tait, which helped define much of modern physics, was titled Treatise on Natural Philosophy (1867).
The word "philosopher" was the term for a biologist, physicist, cosmologist, psychologist etc. before the false divorce between philosophy and science was widespread.
 
## Replies to objections:

* Science is empirical, philosophy is rationalistic. 

This objection assumes science is not philosophy and attempts to articulate the difference. But I have shown above that science and philosophy are coextensive. Mathematics is a rationalistic and not empirical science; applied mathematics is a rationalistic and empirical science. Metaphysics is a rationalistic and (usually) not empirical science; ethics is a rational and empirical science. 

* Science is about nature, philosophy is about concepts. 

This objection also mistakenly assumes science is not philosophy. "Quark" and "Higgs-boson particle" are concepts in physical science that are being debated across schools of thought but are agreed upon within schools of thought. "Nature" and "being" are concepts in metaphysical science that are being debated across schools of thought but are agreed upon within schools of thought

* Science conducts experiments, philosophy only conducts thought experiments. 

This objection also mistakenly assumes science is not philosophy. Some physicists conduct thought experiments and some philosophers of mind conduct empirical experiments. 

* Science progresses, philosophy doesn't progress -- (it is circular or stagnant.)

This objection assumes (a) that all disciplines that progress are sciences and (b) disciplines that do not progress are not sciences, and (c) that all progress is good, and (d) it mistakenly assumes that science is not philosophy. Three responses are possible: 
(a) Physics progresses (from Newton to Einstein), metaphysics progresses (from Anaxagoras to Aquinas). (b) Also, physics, metaphysics, ethics, logic and other disciplines can and does sadly regress. That doesn't mean they are not longer sciences, it means they have lost some truths or acquired some falsehoods. (c) Not all "progress" is good. Progress of a civilization toward decadence is not good, because decadence is not good. Progress of a philosophy department toward racial uniformity is not good because diversity is good. Furthermore, the true "progress" is not of the human race from generation to generation but of each human person within each generation. 

* Science deals with the nature of the universe (a la Aristotle's Physics); philosophy deals with the nature of causation (a la Aristotle's Metaphysics).(http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/is-philosophy-a-science/45795)

This objection also mistakenly assumes science is not philosophy. Physicists deal with causation and metaphysicians deal with the nature of the universe. 

* Science is divided into physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, economics, and so on; philosophy is divided into metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of mind, and so on. These are separate domains. 

This objection also mistakenly assumes science is not philosophy. It is true that there are different disciplines, distinguished by their subject matter, methods, and professional/sociological groups. 

* Science has nothing to do with religion or gods; philosophy overlaps with religious questions like the existence of God, the "true nature of reality", what existed before time and space and what will exist after the heat death of the universe.

* Scientific methods involve testable, confirmable hypotheses; philosophical methods involve abstract, untestable, unconfirmable hypotheses.

* J. L. Mackie argues that ethics and theology are both meaningless for the same reason: they are not empirical. 

Response pending. 

* But Wikipedia says they are different.

Response pending. 

* Science achieves consensus, or increasing convergance on truth; philosophy does not achieve such consensus. 

Response pending. 


## Conclusion

[Reality is partially knowable to us.](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2011/02/can-we-make-sense-of-world.html) All knowledge we have acquired as individuals and a species is science. All knowledge we have acquired as individuals and a species is philosophy. Distinctions between disciplines based on subject matter, methods, professional associations, or distinctions between formal and material disciplines, theoretical and practical disciplines, etc. do not eradicate the underlying unity of the world and the underlying unity of our knowledge. 

### Application ###

What do we do about this? I think first we should invite university science departments and philosophy departments to discuss these conceptual and taxonomy issues. Second, if some are persuaded, we should re-fashion secondary school "science" textbooks to include more history of science and philosophy and to include more contemporary science and philosophy. Third, biologists, physicists, metaphysicians, ethicists, logicians, etc. should attend at least a few of the same conferences, compare the state of the eart of each discipline, and break down ideological barriers that prevent conversation. Fourth, up and coming scientist/philosophers should keep their head in more than one branch of science/philosophy so that their papers, theses, and dissertations reflect the real, undivided nature of knowledge and the world.
