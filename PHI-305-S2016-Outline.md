Are the natural and social lotteries as readily distinguishable as Engelhardt claims? Should the unfortunate also have a right to health care? Should the unfortunate also have a right to receive health care? What are the advantages and disadvantages of Engelhardt’s “Proposed diverse health care packages”?

**W Apr- 27 *Bioethics* 639- 646 (Group 9), Davis, Genetic Dilemmas, Child's Rights**: How does Davis want to reconceive the moral conflict faced by genetic counselors working with parents who want to have a child with a disability?
