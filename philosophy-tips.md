## Reading Tips

* Read ahead. 
* Read carefully. You will get faster, but start slow. 
* *Try to understand* the book. What is the authorâ€™s main point? Is it true?
* Dialogue with the book before class. Take notes. Email me. Talk with each other. Process your thoughts. 
* The two most important questions for each reading 1. What is the main truth claim? 2. What is the evidence?
* Pay attention to what confuses you and what you disagree with. Bring your questions to class.
* Read the book first, and any "Introductions" last, if at all. The introduction is often more confusing than the book.
* Read the book first, and Sparknotes, Cliffnotes, etc. last, if at all. I want you to have your own first impression.
