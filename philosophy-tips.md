# Tips on Philosophy

If you have a great philosophy class experience, it will be because you worked hard. Specifically, you worked hard to read, understand, discuss, and write about philosophy. Here are some tips on each of these activities. 


# Reading Tips

* Read ahead. 
* Read carefully. You will get faster, but start slow. 
* Read the book first, and any "Introductions" last, if at all. The introduction is often more confusing than the book.
* Read the book first, and Sparknotes, Cliffnotes, etc. last, if at all. I want you to have your own first impression. 

## Comprehension tips
*Try to understand* the book. What is the author’s main point? Is it true?

 The two most important questions for each reading 1. What is the main truth claim? 2. What is the evidence?
* Pay attention to what confuses you and what you disagree with. Bring your questions to class.

* Dialogue with the book before class. Take notes. Email me. Talk with each other. Process your thoughts.

## Writing Tips

Writing a paper is an exercising in clear thinking. You must think first, write second. 

### Disputation Instructions

Disputations force you to acknowledge your opponent, respectfully summarize their viewpoint, and criticize it with good arguments. They are "bare bones" papers with no introductin or conclusion. The "skeleton" is showing, since sections are flagged. 

### Philosophy Paper Instructions

Philosophy papers advance a thesis. Like a disputation, they are clear, rigorous, and address objections or counter-arguments. Unlike a disputation, however, they have an introduction, a conclusion, and no section flags.
