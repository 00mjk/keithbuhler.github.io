## Abortion, post-birth termination

>Two ethicists working with Australian universities argue in the latest online edition of the Journal of Medical Ethics that if abortion of a fetus is allowable, so to should be the termination of a newborn.

>Alberto Giubilini with Monash University in Melbourne and Francesca Minerva at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne write that in “circumstances occur[ing] after birth such that they would have justified abortion, what we call after-birth abortion should be permissible.”

>The two are quick to note that they prefer the term “after-birth abortion“ as opposed to ”infanticide.” Why? Because it “[emphasizes] that the moral status of the individual killed is comparable with that of a fetus (on which ‘abortions’ in the traditional sense are performed) rather than to that of a child.” The authors also do not agree with the term euthanasia for this practice as the best interest of the person who would be killed is not necessarily the primary reason his or her life is being terminated. In other words, it may be in the parents’ best interest to terminate the life, not the newborns.

>The circumstances, the authors state, where after-birth abortion should be considered acceptable include instances where the newborn would be putting the well-being of the family at risk, even if it had the potential for an “acceptable” life. The authors cite Downs Syndrome as an example, stating that while the quality of life of individuals with Downs is often reported as happy, “such children might be an unbearable burden on the family and on society as a whole, when the state economically provides for their care.”

>This means a newborn whose family (or society) that could be socially, economically or psychologically burdened or damaged by the newborn should have the ability to seek out an after-birth abortion. They state that after-birth abortions are not preferable over early-term abortions of fetuses but should circumstances change with the family or the fetus in the womb, then they advocate that this option should be made available.

>The authors go on to state that the moral status of a newborn is equivalent to a fetus in that it cannot be considered a person in the “morally relevant sense.”


Question: 

## Abortion, post-birth medical care

>Florida legislators considering a bill to require abortionists to provide medical care to an infant who survives an abortion were shocked during a committee hearing this week when a Planned Parenthood official endorsed a right to post-birth abortion. Alisa LaPolt Snow, the lobbyist representing the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, testified that her organization believes the decision to kill an infant who survives a failed abortion should be left up to the woman seeking an abortion and her abortion doctor. To be clear, sponsor of the bill Republican Rep. Cary Pigman has said his interest in the bill is “solely and strictly to provide care for that infant that is born alive, following any procedure, that it receives full and appropriate resuscitation.” But Snow thinks politicians shouldn’t be the ones to decide “what constitutes the best medically appropriate treatment in any given situation.” 

>Needless to say, the lawmakers were absolutely stunned: "So, um, it is just really hard for me to even ask you this question because I’m almost in disbelief," said Rep. Jim Boyd. "If a baby is born on a table as a result of a botched abortion, what would Planned Parenthood want to have happen to that child that is struggling for life?” "We believe that any decision that's made should be left up to the woman, her family, and the physician," said Planned Parenthood lobbyist Snow. Rep. Daniel Davis then asked Snow, "What happens in a situation where a baby is alive, breathing on a table, moving. What do your physicians do at that point?” "I do not have that information," Snow replied. "I am not a physician, I am not an abortion provider. So I do not have that information.” 

>Rep. Jose Oliva followed up, asking the Planned Parenthood official, "You stated that a baby born alive on a table as a result of a botched abortion that that decision should be left to the doctor and the family. Is that what you’re saying?” Again, Snow replied, “That decision should be between the patient and the health care provider.”“I think that at that point the patient would be the child struggling on the table, wouldn’t you agree?” asked Oliva."That’s a very good question. I really don’t know how to answer that," Snow said. "I would be glad to have some more conversations with you about this.” ([Townhall reporter Leah Barkoukis](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2013/03/29/planned-parenthood-official-endorses-right-to-kill-babies-born-alive-n1553161))


Question: Is a baby who survives an abortion, born alive, now a medical patient to whom the doctors are obligated to give care? 


## American Empire

>The intense controversy that this question engenders is remarkable. On the left, critics of assertive American foreign, military, and economic policies depict these policies as aggressively immoral by branding them “imperial.” On the right, advocates for an even more forceful application of American “hard power,” such as Niall Ferguson and the other members of his self-described “neo-imperialist gang,” argue that the United States should use its immense wealth and military might to impose order and stability on an increasingly chaotic world. 

>The two positions appear to be polar opposites, but they both assume that the United States is in fact an empire. One faction argues that imperial hard power can be put to just and humane uses, while the other sees empires as inherently illegitimate and malevolent. And both sides tend to use the Roman Empire as a cautionary reference point in arguing over whether the “American Empire” is likely to fall. This debate is pointless and ahistorical. The United States is not an empire because, quite simply, there are no empires any more. By strict definition, empire meant the overt, formal, direct, and authoritarian rule of one group of people over another. Empires ruled permanently different and disenfranchised subjects, while the populations of twenty-first century nation states are, at least in theory, rights-bearing citizens. Many of these contemporary states encompass communities that have their own frustrated nationalist ambitions, but no modern government would cite empire as their reason for denying separatist groups the right of self-determination. Doing so would be an open admission of tyranny. Empire became so stigmatized over the course of the twentieth century, particularly after the1960 United Nations resolution 1514 (XV) labeled foreign imperial rule “a denial of fundamental human rights,” that no power would admit to being one. (Timothy Parsons is a Professor of African History at Washington University.)

>Three decades ago, the radical left used the term "American empire" as an epithet. Now that same term has come out of the closet: analysts on both the left and right now use it to explain - if not guide - American foreign policy. In many ways, the metaphor of empire is seductive. The American military has a global reach, with bases around the world, and its regional commanders sometimes act like proconsuls. English is a lingua franca like Latin. The US economy is the largest in the world, and American culture serves as a magnet. But it is a mistake to confuse primacy with empire. ([Joseph Nye](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-s--nye) )


Question: Is America an empire? What is an empire? 


## Apatheia (dispassion, detachment) about God

>And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God, / For I who am curious about each am not curious about God, /  (No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death.) /  I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least. (Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass)

Question: Is Whitman's "peace" about God genuine? Should we be curious about God or be at peace seeing and beholding God in every object but not understanding Him in the least?


>Where is my dewelling place? Where I can never stand. 
>Where is my final goal, toward which I should ascend? 
>It is beyond all place. What should my quest then be? 
>I must, transcending God, into the desert flee. (Angelus Silesius, Cherubinic Wanderer, "One Must Go Beyond God")

Question: Is it possible to go "beyond God"? What does this phrase mean? Is it advisable to "transcend God"? What is the "desert"? 

## Apatheia, (dispassion, detachment)

>“Diogenes Laertius cites life, health, pleasure, beauty, strength, wealth, good reputation, and noble birth as examples of preferables, and death, disease, pain, ugliness, poverty, ad reputation, and low birth, as examples of non-preferables.” (Nicholas Wolterstorff, *Justice: Rights and Wrongs*, (Princeton: 2008), 162)

Question: Are Laertius' "preferables" necessary or just preferable? Are his "non-preferables" horrifying tragedies or merely non-preferrable?



## Christianity, is it a religion?

>If Judaism is a religion, then Christianity is a religion. If Christianity is not a religion, then Judaism is not a religion.

Question: Is Christianity a religion? 

## Conservatism

>“Adams also excoriated the French speculators not only for their infatuation with human perfectibility, but also for their love of equality. Adams insisted that, far from all men being substantially equal, there actually is a natural aristocracy of men, formed from the benefactors of the unavoidable inequality of humankind. Like Burke, Adams held to every man having equal rights to his own and equal standing before God. Beyond that, though, men are unequal in their powers and faculties, influence in society, property and advantages, piety and iniquity, and nearly every other attribute.” (Russel Kirk, “The Conservative Mind”)

Question: Are human beings "equal"? If so, in what respect? If not, then is equality a moral ideal or not? 

>“Many people on the left are skeptical towards utopian impulses; at the same time, having allied themselves beneath a moralizing banner, they inevitably find themselves galvanized, inspired and eventually governed by the most fervent members of their sect. For politics on the left is politics with a goal: your place within the alliance is judged by the lengths you are prepared to go to on behalf of ‘social justice’, however defined.” (—Roger Scruton, “Thinkers of the New Left”)

Question: Is leftist politics utopian? If so, is it necessarily utopian or only contingently? If not, why is "social justice" so hard to define, picture, imagine, or illustrate with examples from history or literature? 

>“After the long domination of liberalism, with its adulation of the “common man,” its faith in mechanistic political solutions to all human problems, its rejection of the tragic and heroic aspects of life, and the not exactly inspiring prose in which its ideas are usually expressed, after all this, I repeat, such sentiments as “the unbought grace of life,” the “eternal chain of right and duty which links great and obscure, living and dead,” a view of politics as “the art of apprehending and applying the Justice which is above nature,” came like rain after a long drought.” (Henry Regnery, introduction to Russell Kirk, The Conservative Mind)

Question: Is liberalism aesthetically vulgar, socially ignoble, and sentimentally demoralizing? If so, why do socialists blame capitalism and capitalists blame socialists for this vulgarity and demoralization?


## Consciousness

>If we look for consciousness in the physical world, all we find are increasingly complex systems giving rise to increasingly complex behavior -- which may or may not be attended by consciousness”. (Sam Harris, [“The Mystery of Consciousness”](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-mystery-of-consciousness-ii/))

Question: Is consciousness correlated with or caused by complex physical systems? Is consciousness correlated with or identical to complex physical systems?

## Lying

>“Kant and Sidgwick take views at opposite extremes about whether we may tell paternalistic lies. I trace the extremism to their views about ethical concepts. Sidgwick thinks that fundamental ethical concepts must be capable of precise application. Common Sense morality says we may tell paternalistic lies to children but not to sane adults. Because the distinction between a child and an adult is imprecise, Sidgwick thinks this principle cannot be fundamental, and must be based on the principle of utility, which he thinks can always (in principle) be precisely applied, and which often mandates paternalistic lies to adults. Kant thinks that ethical concepts are ideals of reason, which cannot be applied to things in the empirical world precisely because the world is imperfect. We lie to children and the insane because they are not perfectly rational, but no one is perfectly rational. We must treat all persons with the respect due to rational agents, so the pressure of the theory is toward not lying to anyone. In this kind of ideal theory, decisions about where to draw the line must be made pragmatically, like the decision who counts as an adult in the law, and to some extent arbitrarily. But fear of this is not a good reason to abandon ethical ideals for utilitarianism.” (Paternalistic lying (to children) is wrong)

Question: Is paternalistic lying wrong? 






## Civil Dialog

>“If you humanize your enemies, you might be dehumanized by your friends.” ([Cassie Jaye, interview with Jesse Lee Peterson on The Fallen State.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8i0Rwyyc0M))


>“Willingness to engage in an honest and civil manner those on the other side is a sign of confidence in the truth, not lack of conviction or courage.” (Robert George, Facebook post)

Question: Is it morally permissible to dialog in a civil manner with those whose views are not just mistaken but in some sense immoral, depraved, wicked, hateful, hurtful, or deluded? 


## Normativity, subjective

> Korsgaard began with a search for moral entities (and values) that might provide the basis for normativity. She concludes that all the accounts of normativity she discusses are "true": Normativity must spring from the commands of a legislative authority. (Hobbes);  Reasons are intrinsically moral entities. What we should do when a desire presents itself is to reflect on it, to look at it more objectively to see whether it is such an entity. (Clarke, Moore, Nagel); Reflection has the power to compel obedience, and to punish us for disobedience. It in turn is bound to govern us by laws that are good. Reflection makes us authorities over ourselves. (Hume, Mill, Williams); In so far as we have authority over ourselves, we can make laws for ourselves, and those laws will be normative. Autonomy is the source of moral obligation. (Kant, Rawls, Korsgaard)


Question: Is autonomy the source of moral obligation? 

## Normativity, objective

>  1. “I believe that there are irreducibly normative truths and facts, facts such that we should care about our future well-being, that we should not humiliate other people, that we should not reason and form beliefs in ways we know to be unreliable. These are, of course, just examples: even if I am wrong about them, I believe there must be some examples of this sort, examples of normative (and indeed moral) truths that are irreducibly normative, truths that are perfectly objective, universal, absolute. They are independent of us, our desires and our (or anyone else’s) will. And our thinking and talking about them amounts not just to an expression of any practical attitudes, but to a representation of these normative truths and facts. These normative truths are truths that, when successful in our normative inquiries, we discover rather than create or construct. They are, in other words, just as respectable as empirical or mathematical truths (at least, that is, according to scientific and mathematical realists). (David Enoch, Taking Morality Seriously 1)



> 2. "According to Mackie, it is fantastic to think that the world contains objective values, or intrinsically normative entities. For in order to do what values do, they would have to meet certain impossible criteria. They would have to be entities of a very strange sort. utterly unlike anything else in the universe. The way that we know them would have to be different from the way that we know other sorts of facts. Knowledge of them, Mackie said, would have to provide the knower with both a direction and a motive. For when you met an objective value, according to Mackie, it would have to be — and I'm nearly quoting now — able both to tell you what to do and make you do it. And nothing is like that. But Mackie is wrong and realism is right. Of course there are entities that meet these criteria. It's true that they are queer sorts of entities, and that knowing them isn't like anything else. But that doesn't mean that they don't exist. John Mackie must have been alone in his room with the Scientific World View when he wrote those words. For it is the most familiar fact of human life that the world contains entities that can tell us what to do and make us do it. They are people, and the other animals." (Korsgaard, *The Sources of Normativity*, p.166)


> 3. “I wish mainly to applaud [Robert] Adams's defense of a framework that takes the idea of a transcendent good seriously. However large are the problems the idea carries with it, the fact remains that it captures a great deal of ordinary thought and experience of  value that no anthropocentric, subjectivist, or naturalist conception of value can." Susan Wolf, "A World of Goods" Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol 64, No. 2, March 2002. [Taking morality seriously]

> 4. All morality is trained into young people by their culture. All things trained into young people by their culture are subjective, that is, neither true nor false. Therefore, it would seem that all morality is subjective. However, the second premise is false. Some things trained into young people by the culture are objective, such as the notion that twice a number is double, that squares have four corners, that the sun is millions of miles away from the earth, that ancient Egyptians built the pyramids, and so on.

> 4. "If people are not outraged, they need to be."  (Jerry Miller, Controller, Mountain Pure Water)


Question: Does the evidence suggest that normative claims just as real as empirical or mathematical facts? If so, is there any serious contender to this view? If not, are all normative claims, including epistemic claims about what the evidence suggests, equally false? 





## Total Truth

> We should reject the idea that knowledge can be divided into two (or any number) of separate realms. "Religious knowledge" and "secular knowledge" are particularly inadequate and even dangerous categories to start with. Such divisions are practical constructions that help us organize the world, but they don't reflect the way the world actually is. An alien anthropologist might conclude that physics and biology are somehow "different and separate" because of the way they function in our universities and laboratories. But we know that the world is not adorned with little flags labeled "biological phenomena" and "physical phenomena" to help us assign the problems to the right department. The arrangement in our great universities where these disciplines are housed in separate buildings, reflects the practical reality that the problems of those disciplines are sufficiently different that people tend to be drawn to one or the other. But we know that there can be no discrete separation, for those disciplines meet constantly to engage problems of optics, joint mechanics, blood pressure and so on. And we know that it would be meaningless to dispute about whether the study of blood pressure or near-sightedness properly belonged to physics or biology.            

> In the same way -- but far more importantly -- we cannot divide the world on a large scale into "secular" and "religious." A slightly less flawed, but still too simple, knowledge map would be a continuum stretching from "religious knowledge claims" at one end to "anti-religious knowledge claims" at the other with "secular knowledge claims" somewhere in the middle. ([Karl Giberson, Christianity and the Secular World](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christianity-and-the-secular-world_b_1032515.html))


Question: How should the branches of knowledge be divided? Is theology a science? Is physics natural philosophy? Is history a theological discipline? 




## Moral Argument for the Existence of God

> If there is no God, all is permissible. (Dostoyevsky).  There is no god. Therefore, either all is permissible, or it is false that all is permissible. If it is false that all is permissible, then there is a god. 


> Morality conceived as a *moral law* is incoherent without Divine Law, because if there is no divine *lawgiver*, there can be no moral *law*. According to the atheist or agnostic, we cannot affirm a divine lawgiver, so we cannot help ourselves to a moral law. That said, the only two metaethical options for grounding objective morality are moral law or in the virtues which are grounded in human nature. There is no moral law, yet there is real objective morality. Therefore, the only or best secular grounding for objective morality is virtue ethics. (Paraphrasing Elizabeth Anscombe)


Question: Is anything wrong? If so, must there therefore be a God? 



## Justice

> If justice is fairness, then the right should take priority over the good, because.... The second part of the paper examines the concept of priority of the right. It argues that such a concept should not be identified with that of deontology— indeed, deontological theories do not necessarily assign priority to the right over the good. However, it contends that the concept of priority of the right is essential to explaining what specific kind of deontological theory "justice as fairness" is. Justice as fairness is a deontological theory which assigns priority to the right as a consequence of its commitment to a neutral position with respect to different accounts of what is ultimately valuable and good. (Miriam Ronzini, "Teleology, Deontology, and the Priority of the Right: On Some Unappreciated Distinctions", *Ethical Theory and Moral Practice*, Vol. 13, No. 4 (August 2010), pp. 453-472)


Question: Is justice fairness or harmony? 




## Naturalism

> “G. E. Moore's Principia Ethica in 1903, however, ‘naturalism’ has served anglophone moral philosophy above all as a name of a type of metaethical position, a view about the meaning of ethical terms and the nature of ethical properties. It is, roughly, the view that ethical terms signify natural properties, properties that are or will be mentioned in the best development of the natural sciences, including psychology and the other social sciences. (Robert Adams, Finite and Infinite Goods, I. 2. 2) 



> “Naturalism, as presented by the essays in this volume, is not so much a system or a body of doctrine as an attitude and temper: it is essentially a philosophic method and a program. It undertakes to bring scientific analysis and criticism to bear on all the human enterprises and values so zealously maintained by the traditional supernaturalists and by the more sophisticated idealists.” (Thelma Z. Lavine and Clarence J. Robinson. "Modernity and the Spirit of Naturalism", Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association, Vol. 65, No. 3 (Nov., 1991), pp. 73-83)


## Naturalism, ancient naturalists

1. The most clear-cut naturalist school, the atomist school of Leucippus, Democritus, Nausiphanes, Anaxarchus, Epicurus, Lucretius, etc., included justified naturalists (in the sense I explained). They argued against the religion of their time and put a naturalist world-view in its place. The second basic ontological why-question, why are there these things and laws rather than others, can be answered in one of two ways by the atomists.  The uncaused “swerve” is a later invention of Epicurus in his attempt to explain free will; at that time, philosophers did not know the conceptual distinction between compatibilism and hard determinism. Further, we should not suppose they had a clear conceptual distinction between causal laws and instances of these, as we have today. Rather, this seems to be what they vaguely had in mind. Given this, we can say this much: Each basic law is a regularity, i.e., atomic events of a certain type nomically causing other atomic events of a certain type. The obtaining of a basic law at any given time is a causal consequence of the obtaining of the law at an earlier time. In this way, not only the states of the universe are causally explained, but also the causal laws. Notice how Aristotle strawmans Democritus and mis-states his causal explanation as a temporal pseudo-explanation in Physics VIII. 252 a.32. Aristotle’s strawman Democritus is represented as holding that “something happens in a given way because it has always happened that way.” Note that Aristotle drops causality from the explanation Democritus gave. If we state Democritus’ theory the right way, in terms of a causal explanation, the burden of proof is then on Aristotle to tell us why the statement, “for any given time t, the causal law L is caused to obtain at that time, and it is caused to obtain at that time by the obtaining of L at an earlier time t* < t,” is not an answer to the question, “why does the law obtain at all times (in an infinite past)?” The supernaturalists often respond at this point by equivocating, claiming their real question is not “why does the law obtain at all the times in an infinite past?” but “why does this law actually obtain, rather than some other law that could have obtained, but which in actuality does not obtain?” which is not a question about temporality but about modality. (Quentin Smith, “Metaphilosophy of Naturalism”)

## Naturalism, queerness

1. "I am not greatly enamoured of some of the motivations which prompt the advocacy of psychophysical identifications; I have in mind a concern to exclude such ‘queer’ or ‘mysterious’ entities as souls, purely mental events, purely mental properties and so forth. My taste is for keeping open house for all sorts of conditions of entities, just so long as when they come in they help with the housework. Provided that I can see them work, and provided that they are not detected in illicit logical behaviour (within which I do not include a certain degree of indeterminacy, not even of numerical indeterminacy), I do not find them queer or mysterious at all…. To fangle a new ontological Marxism, they work therefore they exist, even though only some, perhaps those who come on the recommendation of some form of transcendental argument, may qualify for the specially favoured status of entia realissima. To exclude honest working entities seems to me like metaphysical snobbery, a reluctance to be seen in the company of any but the best objects." (1975, 30–31 Grice's ‘Method in Philosophical Psychology’,)


## Naturalism, materialism is unlivable
2. You can sympathize with Leiter and Weisberg for fudging on materialism. As a philosophy of everything it is an undeniable drag. As a way of life it would be even worse. Fortunately, materialism is never translated into life as it’s lived. As colleagues and friends, husbands and mothers, wives and fathers, sons and daughters, materialists never put their money where their mouth is. Nobody thinks his daughter is just molecules in motion and nothing but; nobody thinks the Holocaust was evil, but only in a relative, provisional sense. A materialist who lived his life according to his professed convictions—understanding himself to have no moral agency at all, seeing his friends and enemies and family as genetically determined robots—wouldn’t just be a materialist: He’d be a psychopath. Say what you will about Leiter and Weisberg and the workshoppers in the Berkshires. From what I can tell, none of them is a psychopath. Not even close.    Applied beyond its own usefulness as a scientific methodology, materialism is, as Nagel suggests, self-evidently absurd. *Mind and Cosmos* can be read as an extended paraphrase of Orwell’s famous insult: “One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool.” Materialism can only be taken seriously as a philosophy through a heroic feat of cognitive dissonance; pretending, in our abstract, intellectual life, that values like truth and goodness have no objective content even as, in our private life, we try to learn what’s really true and behave in a way we know to be good. Nagel has sealed his ostracism from the intelligentsia by idly speculating why his fellow intellectuals would undertake such a feat.  “The priority given to evolutionary naturalism in the face of its implausible conclusions,” he writes, “is due, I think, to the secular consensus that this is the only form of external understanding of ourselves that provides an alternative to theism.” (Andrew Ferguson, “Nagel the Heretic” The Weekly Standard)
3. “There is no reason to allow our confidence in the objective truth of our moral beliefs, or for that matter our confidence in the objective truth of our mathematical or scientific reasoning, to depend on whether this is consistent with the assumption that those capacities are the product of natural selection. Given how speculative evolutionary explanations of human mental faculties are, they seem to weak a ground for putting into question the most basic forms of thought. Our confidence in the truth of propositions that seem evident on reflection should not be shaken so easily (and, I would add, cannot be shaken on those sorts of grounds without a kind of false consciousness. It seems reasonable to run the test equally in the oppoiste direction: namely, to evaluate hypotheses about the universe and how we have come into existence by reference to ordinary judgments in which we have a very high confidence.”  (Thomas Nagel, Mind and Cosmos. Oxford 2012. p. 29)
4. “One of the difficulties in this area is to describe a form of value realism that is not weighed down by metaphysical baggage but that is still clearly distinguishable from a sophisticated subjectivist conception of value. Value realism is highly controversial because subjectivist accounts of value are not flagrantly implausible in the way that subjectivist accounts of science or materialist accounts of consciousness are.” (Thomas Nagel, Mind and Cosmos. Oxford 2012. 98)
5. “In simple terms, the subjectivist position that I will contrast with realism is that evaluative and moral truth depend on our motivational dispositions and responses, whereas the realist position is that on the contrary, our responses try to reflect the evaluative truth and can be correct or incorrect by reference to it.” (Thomas Nagel, Mind and Cosmos. Oxford 2012. 98-99)
6. “The reductive method in question is like the method of getting rid of all the dirt in the house by sweeping it under a certain rug.  While this is a very effective way of getting rid of the dirt everywhere else, it is not a strategy that could possibly be used to get rid of the dirt under the rug itself.” (Edward Feser, “Nagel and His Critics: Part II)
7. Be that as it may, the only way to be a materialist consistent with the method Nagel describes is to be a materialist of the eliminative rather than reductive kind.  Contemporary non-reductive materialism fails as a third option because it fails to be materialist.  To acknowledge that higher-level features of the natural world are as real as the lower-level features but irreducible to them is either property dualism or an implicit Aristotelianism -- essentially a recapitulation of Aristotle’s critique of the ancient atomism that is the ancestor of modern materialism.  (Edward Feser, “Nagel and His Critics: Part II)
8. If the argument of “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” is correct, then it is not merely improbable that what Nagel there calls “objective” facts should by themselves give rise to “subjective” facts, but impossible, for they differ qualitatively rather than merely quantitatively.  To borrow an example used by the Thomist William A. Wallace in another context, a polygon is just a different sort of thing from a circle, no matter how closely you approximate a circle by adding sides to a polygon.  And that a circle might arise from nothing more than the successive addition of sides to a polygon is therefore not merely improbable orunpredictable; it is impossible in principle. (Edward Feser, “Nagel and His Critics, Part III)



## Naturalism, absurdity of epistemological naturalism
4. Suppose someone beholden to the idea that coins and other metallic objects are all that exist was confronted with all the obvious counterevidence -- trees, rocks, people, animals, glass, plastic, and all the other non-metal objects there are.  And suppose he acknowledged that there is an “explanatory gap” here but that it rested on a “cognitive illusion” that made trees, rocks, etc. seem“vaguely spooky” insofar as they appeared to “float free of their metallic substrates.”  Of course, no one would take such an absurd suggestion seriously for a moment. ([Feser, Nagel and his Critics, Part IV](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2012/11/nagel-and-his-critics-part-iv.html))

## Naturalism, absurdity of eliminative materialism

5. “If it isn’t literally true that my wanting is causally responsible for my reaching, and my itching is causally responsible for my scratching, and my believing is causally responsible for saying..., if none of that is literally true, then practically everything I believe about anything is false and it’s the end of the world.” (Jerry Fodor, “Making Mind Matter More,” reprinted in A Theory of Content and Other Essays (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1990), p. 156. First published in 1989. Quoted in Jaegwon Kim, Physicalism or Something Near Enough. 

## Naturalism, liberal naturalism

6. Liberal Naturalism [is] the contemporary label for the kind of naturalism inspired, amongst others, by Price and John McDowell. Although Liberal Naturalism incorporates a range of views, a central tenet is that there is more to what is natural, and more to how we can investigate it, than Scientific Naturalism could allow. The "serious metaphysics" which underpins orthodox naturalism operates by either 'eliminating or locating' normative features of the world, as Frank Jackson puts it. Roughly speaking, once Scientific Naturalism has been 'liberalized' it can accommodate a broader range of entities and ways of understanding. Both Scientific and Liberal versions of naturalism reject supernatural entities (spirits, Cartesian minds) and supernatural faculties of knowing (mystical insight, spiritual intuition), but adopt different stances toward normativity -- specifically about how and where to 'locate' normativity with regard to the natural world. This, the 'placement problem', poses a challenge to conventional forms of naturalism since the scientific image of the world ultimately has no place for normative phenomena. De Caro and Macarthur explain that the placement problem is apparently intractable for the scientific naturalist orthodoxy. (Mario De Caro and David Macarthur (eds.), Naturalism and Normativity, Columbia University Press, 2010.)
7. A more sensible materialism goes no further than the rejection of spooky stuff: whatever kinds of stuff there may turn out to be and whatever they turn out to do, they are, as long as this turning out is empirically grounded, ipso facto not spooky.  Such a materialism is quite untouched by Nagel's arguments. (Dupre, review of Nagel’s Mind and Cosmos, quoted in Edward Feser “Nagel and his Critics” Part V)

7. "To its supporters, [nonreductive physicalism] offers the best of both worlds, while its critics see it as cheating or attempting (unsuccessfully) to pass as a member of the physicalist club without paying one's mandatory dues." (Anthony Freemon, ed., The Emergence of Consciousness, (Imprint: 2001), 22.)



## Naturalism, fear of the supernatural

1. “The “appeal” is more likely the “appeal” of a medicine that tastes awful (and even has some unpleasant side effects) but that one takes to avert or cure a serious illness. “Naturalism,” I believe, is often driven by fear, fear that accepting conceptual pluralism will let in the “occult,” the “supernatural.” But before I say a word or two more about the nature of this fear, let us first look at the arguments for naturalism that seem to convince more philosophers (more students, at any rate) than any others.” (Putnam, “Content and Appeal of Naturalism” in Naturalism in Question  66.)

## Naturalism, causal closure
2. “The dualist ought not to worry about closure. Depending upon how one defines “physical,” the resulting causal closure principle will either be (a) false, (b) compatible with interaction, or (c) obviously question-begging.” Dolores Morris, Physicalism, Dualism and the Mind-Body Problem, Dissertation. Accessed online 03/13/14. 149. 



## Naturalism, nature is normative

1. "He was a seaman," said George Merry, who, bolder than the rest, had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing. "Leastways, this is good sea-cloth." "Aye, aye," said Silver; "like enough; you wouldn't look to find a bishop here, I reckon. But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie? 'Tain't in natur'." And the rest were all too terrified to reply. They would have run away severally had they dared; but fear kept them together, and kept them close by John, as if his daring helped them. He, on his part, had pretty well fought his weakness down. "Sperrit? Well, maybe," he said. "But there's one thing not clear to me. There was an echo. Now, no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow; well then, what's he doing with an echo to him, I should like to know? That ain't in natur', surely?" (Lord of the Flies. NB: The first use of “in nature” means “that kind of thing doesn’t happen in physical, empirical nature.” The second use of “in nature” means “that’s not the kind of thing that happens.”)
2. “Nature has pointed out a mixed kind of life most suitable to human race … Indulge your passion for science, says she, but let your science be human" (Hume, Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, 9).
3. "A volitional analysis of the good, such as Stevenson and Hare give, has two serious shortcomings. First, it has to limit good to human contexts, and second, it cannot, even there, account for all senses of good" (Simpson, Goodness and Nature 136)



## Nihilism, the god of nihilism

5. “No man, we have said often enough, lives without a god; who then--or what--is the god of the Nihilist? It is nihil, nothingness itself-not the nothingness of absence or non-existence, but of apostasy and denial; it is the "corpse" of the "dead God" which so weighs upon the Nihilist. The God hitherto so real and so present to Christian men cannot be disposed of overnight; so absolute a monarch can have no immediate successor. So it is that, at the present moment of man's spiritual history--a moment, admittedly, of crisis and transition--a dead God, a great void, stands at the center of man's faith…” (Roger Scruton, “Thinkers of the New Left”)

## Nihilism, the rejection of reason
6. “It is enough for us that our enemies have retreated from the territory of reason, on which they once claimed so many victories, and have fallen back upon the borderlands of myth and mysticism, like so many other barbarians with whom civilization is at war.” (G.K. Chesterton)

## Nihilism, despair
7. That man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labors of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of man’s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins—all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul’s habitation henceforth be safely built. (Bertrand Russell, "Free Man's Worship")

## Nihilism, 

>"Indeed, throughout the modern period, we have progressively redefined the human enterprise in terms of self-interested pursuit of materialistic values, with reason regarded as the servant of desire and knowledge as power in exploiting the environment and imposing our will upon the world for materialistic gain. This worked a reformation in science, and with the success of modern science in the economic, medical, and military enterprises, it has come to dominate our intellectual life and to shape our vision of humankind and the world. The results have been the disenchantment of the world (what Nietzsche called the "death of God"), a severe human identity crisis (what C. S. Lewis called the "abolition of man"), and a cut-flower moral, civic, artistic, and religious culture." (E. M. Adams)





## Physicalism

1. “The mind-body problem, for us, the would-be physicalists, has come down to two problems, mental causation and consciousness, and these together represent the most profound challenge to physicalism. If physicalism is to survive as a worldview for us, it must show just where we belong in the physical world, and this means that it must give an account of our status as conscious creatures with powers to affect our surroundings in virtue of our consciousness and mentality. The arguments that have been presented here already suggest that physicalism will not be able to survive intact and in its entirety. We will try to determine how much of it can survive, and we will see, I hope, that what does survive is good enough for us.” (Jaegwon Kim, Physicalism or Something Near Enough, Princeton Press, 2005. P 30)
2. "Fundamental reality” and “physical reality” are conceptually distinct. We have certain beliefs about what it takes for something to be fundamental that are quite independent of anything that has been learned by way of physics. For instance, it is manifestly known by the “natural light” that fundamental reality must be independent  (if it were dependent how could it be fundamental?)We do not know in advance that whatever it is that physics is ultimately studying (i.e., whatever the nature of the physical turns out to be) will be the sort of thing that even could be fundamental. The reader might object that I have begun to sneak conceptual analysis back into the picture, having just set it aside. Conceptual analysis will continue to play an important role but it is conceptual analysis about Reality in itself that is in question, not conceptual analysis about ordinary common sense postulates." ([Adam Labecki, *Necessary Substances*](https://www.academia.edu/4553772/Necessary_Substances_Dissertation_))
3. “[Physicalism] is not a theory in physics, nor more generally a result established by modern physical science. It is rather a metaphysical theory, inspired by enthusiasm for science. It holds, roughly, that all the facts there are can in principle be described in the vocabulary, and explained by the laws, of modern physics, in some ideal development thereof. It is obvious that such a theory is issuing large promissory notes to be paid by future developments, and hence is highly speculative. It is attended by much‐debated and, I believe, grave and unresolved difficulties. Given the strength of our confidence in many pretheoretical evaluative and normative beliefs, and the pervasiveness of their role in our thinking, I believe that physicalism has much more need to be found compatible with them than they have to be found compatible with it. This is not an argument against physicalism; that's business for another occasion. It is rather an argument for not allowing physicalist worries to undermine ethical beliefs.” (Adams, Finite and Infinite Goods, p. 77)



## Slander

1.  “[When you go on TV, enemies will waste your time with] malicious, slanderous, libelous, defamatory statements…”(Cassie Jaye, interview with Jesse Lee Peterson on The Fallen State.)


## Sexuality and Religion

1. "Judaism is against paganism... The essence of paganism is unchastity." -- Milton Himmelfarb (First Things magazine, March 1991)



## Science, Scientism

1. “Gilbert Ryle somewhere remarked that there is no such thing as science. His point of course was not to deny the obvious existence of science, but rather to emphasise the plurality of the sciences. Philosophers have sometimes made it seem as if there were only one science, namely physics. But even a casual perusal of a university course directory reveals that there are plenty of others, such as meteorology, geology, zoology, biochemistryn, europhysiologyp, sychology,s ociology, ecology, molecular biology, and so on. So there are many sciences.Alongside this profusion of sciences, however, which is manifestly observable, there is a vaguer, more philosophical, and more intuitive thought, the thought that somehow it must be possible for the many sciences to fit together so as to constitute what is in some sense a single and unified account of the world; and possible also for the respective domains of the many sciences - the entities and properties they seem to be about - to fit together so as to constitute a single and unified world. Consequently, a pair of questions naturally arises: how, exactly, are the domains... [and how do they fit together...]” (Melnyk, “Being a Physicalist: How and Why” 223)
2. “We think the RIP principle's specious appeal actually rests on two other prejudices. One is the old dream of the 'unity of science', of being able to derive all scientific laws from one 'ever more adequate grand scheme'. But we see no reason either to believe in or to aim for such a scheme. The world even of the admittedly physical sciences contains a vast number of very different kinds of entities, properties and facts. That is why so many different sciences, using widely different methods, are needed to study them. No one could think astrophysics and genetics unified even in their methods, except under the most abstract descriptions of scientific method- ology. And in their contents, they display no more unity than that of a conjunction. Nothing wrong with that: but then why cannot psychology supply another conjunct?” (Crane and Mellor, “There is No Question of Physicalism” 188)
3. I suppose that sooner or later the physicists will complete the catalogue they've been compiling of the ultimate and irreducible properties of things. When they do, the likes of spin, charm, and charge will perhaps appear on their list. But aboutness surely won't; intentionality simply doesn't go that deep.' (J. A. Fodor, Psychosemantics: the Problem of Meaning in the Philosophy of Mind, Cambridge, Mass., MIT Press, I987, p. 97.)
4. "In fact there is not, and never has been, any war between science and religion at all. There has instead been a conflict between two entirely philosophical conceptions of the natural order: on the one hand, the classical "teleological" vision of Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas, on which purpose or goal-directedness is as inherent a feature of the physical world as mass or electric charge; and the modern "mechanical" vision of Descartes, Hobbes, Locke, and Hume, according to which the physical world is comprised of nothing more than purposeless, meaningless particles in motion. The modern "mechanical" picture has never been established by science, and cannot be, for it is not a scientific theory in the first place but merely a philosophical interpretation of science." (paraphrasing Edward Feser's argument in *The Last Superstition*)
5. "The universe-wide microphysical machine, the integrated realm of microscopic particles that forms the substance of reductionist fantasies, is not the product of naturalistic inquiry, but a supernatural construct of the scientific dreamer." (Dupre, "The Miracle of Monism" Naturalism in Question, Harvard: 2004. p. 52)
6. Graham Harman rejects scientism on account of its anthropocentrism: "[T]here’s a more insidious form of human-centric ontology, as found in many version of scientism. On the one hand, scientism insists that human consciousness is nothing special, and should be naturalized just like everything else. On the other hand, it also wants to preserve knowledge as a special kind of relation to the world quite different from the relations that raindrops and lizards have to the world. Another of putting it… for all their gloating over the fact that people are pieces of matter just like everything else, they also want to claim that the very status of that utterance is somehow special. For them, raindrops know nothing and lizards know very little, and some humans are more knowledgeable than others. This is only possible because thought is given a unique ability to negate and transcend immediate experience, which inanimate matter is never allowed to do in such theories, of course. In short, for all its noir claims that the human doesn’t exist, it elevates the structure of human thought to the ontological pinnacle.” (http://ecologywithoutnature.blogspot.com/2011/10/harman-on-anthropocentrism.html)
7. The appeal of materialism lies precisely in this, in its claim to be natural metaphysics within the bounds of science. That a doctrine which promises to gratify our ambition (to know the noumenal) and our caution (not to be unscientific) should have great appeal is hardly something to be wondered at. (Putnam (1983), p.210) 






## Science, Pseudoscience

6. The English word “science” is primarily used about the natural sciences and other fields of research that are considered to be similar to them. Hence, political economy and sociology are counted as sciences, whereas studies of literature and history are usually not. The corresponding German word, “Wissenschaft”, has a much broader meaning and includes all the academic specialties, including the humanities. The German term has the advantage of more adequately delimiting of the type of systematic knowledge that is at stake in the conflict between science and pseudoscience. The misrepresentations of history presented by Holocaust deniers and other pseudo-historians are very similar in nature to the misrepresentations of natural science promoted by creationists and homeopaths.   More importantly, the natural and social sciences and the humanities are all parts of the same human endeavour, namely systematic and critical investigations aimed at acquiring the best possible understanding of the workings of nature, people, and human society. The disciplines that form this community of knowledge disciplines are increasingly interdependent (Hansson 2007). Since the second half of the 20th century, integrative disciplines such as astrophysics, evolutionary biology, biochemistry, ecology, quantum chemistry, the neurosciences, and game theory have developed at dramatic speed and contributed to tying together previously unconnected disciplines. These increased interconnections have also linked the sciences and the humanities closer to each other, as can be seen for instance from how historical knowledge relies increasingly on advanced scientific analysis of archaeological findings. The conflict between science and pseudoscience is best understood with this extended sense of science. On one side of the conflict we find the community of knowledge disciplines that includes the natural and social sciences and the humanities. On the other side we find a wide variety of movements and doctrines, such as creationism, astrology, homeopathy, and Holocaust denialism that are in conflict with results and methods that are generally accepted in the community of knowledge disciplines. (Hansson, ([Sven Ove, "Science and Pseudo-Science", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/pseudo-science/))





## Science, Consensus

1.  “There have been countless times in history where the majority of scientists and researchers agreed…and were wrong. Also, using the term “consensus” in this way is always dangerous in the realm of scientific research because there is an automatic obedience to authority for the simple reason that most people are not truly educated on complex matters of science. A famous example of the consensus error is called the Semmelweis Reflex. Ignaz Semmelweis was a doctor who found—and argued—that hand-washing by doctors reduced childbed fever mortality rates ten-fold. It turns out that medical doctors (the trusted authority) used to perform autopsies and then see patients, including pregnant women, without washing their hands. This was the widely accepted practice at the time and Semmelweis objected to it. He was eventually shouted down and run into an insane asylum (literally) by his peers for advocating something that is blatantly obvious to us today.” (https://medium.com/@therebootedbody/bringing-much-needed-sanity-to-the-vaccine-debate-e143f089bfd1)
2. “I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you're being had.... Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.     There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus. Period.” ― Michael Crichton


## Science, the origin of the term

1. “Science..loses all traces of unity. A curious illustration of this result may be observed in the want of any name by which we can designate the students of the knowledge of the material world collectively. We are informed that this difficulty was felt very oppressively by the members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at their meetings..in the last three summers...Philosophers was felt to be too wide and too lofty a term,..; savans was rather assuming,..; some ingenious gentleman proposed that, by analogy with artist, they might form scientist, and added that there could be no scruple in making free with this termination when we have such words as sciolist, economist, and atheist—but this was not generally palatable.” (In 1834.   W. Whewell in Q. Rev. 51 59.)






## Virtue

1. Prudence disposes us in all circumstances to form right judgments about what we must do or not do. Justice disposes us to give everyone what belongs to him. Fortitude disposes us to do what is good in spite of any difficulty. Temperance disposes us to control our desires and to use rightly the things which please ourselves. Filial piety and patriotism, which dispose us to honor, love, and respect our parents and our country. Obedience, which disposes us to do the will of our superiors. Veracity, which disposes us to tell the truth. Liberality, which disposes us rightly to use worldly goods. Patience, which disposes us to bear up under trials and difficulties. Humility, which disposes us to acknowledge our limitations. Chastity, or purity, which disposes us to be pure in soul and body Besides these, there are many other moral virtues.  ([The Baltimore Catechism, Lesson 10](http://www.catholicity.com/baltimore-catechism/lesson10.html))
2. “Virtue ethics' founding fathers are Plato and, more particularly Aristotle (its roots in Chinese philosophy are even more ancient) and it persisted as the dominant approach in Western moral philosophy until at least the Enlightenment. It suffered a momentary eclipse during the nineteenth century but re-emerged in the late 1950's in Anglo-American philosophy. It was heralded by Anscombe's famous article “Modern Moral Philosophy” (Anscombe 1958) which crystallized an increasing dissatisfaction with the forms of deontology and utilitarianism then prevailing. Neither of them, at that time, paid attention to a number of topics that had always figured in the virtue ethics' tradition—the virtues themselves, motives and moral character, moral education, moral wisdom or discernment, friendship and family relationships, a deep concept of happiness, the role of the emotions in our moral life and the fundamentally important questions of what sort of person I should be and how we should live.” ([Rosalind Hursthouse, “Virtue Ethics”, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2013 Edition).](http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/ethics-virtue/))






## Veneration for the King

>In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard. This was the Emperors' suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank, and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march. It seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as if the army itself, rejoicing at the Emperors' approach, had naturally burst into music. Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor Alexander was clearly heard. He gave the words of greeting, and the first regiment roared "Hurrah!" so deafeningly, continuously, and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted.

>Rostov, standing in the front lines of Kutuzov's army which the Tsar approached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in that army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of might, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph.

>He felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass (and he himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and water, commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word.

>"Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!" thundered from all sides, one regiment after another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then "Hurrah!"... Then the general march, and again "Hurrah! Hurrah!" growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.

>Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive, its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices, amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone, hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely, and in front of them two men- the Emperors. Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was concentrated.

>The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyone's attention.

>Rostov was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within twenty paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every movement of the Tsar's seemed to him enchanting.

>Stopping in front of the Pavlograds, the Tsar said something in French to the Austrian Emperor and smiled.

>Seeing that smile, Rostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.

>"Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?" thought Rostov. "I should die of happiness!"

>The Tsar addressed the officers also: "I thank you all, gentlemen, I thank you with my whole heart." To Rostov every word sounded like a voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!

>"You have earned the St. George's standards and will be worthy of them."

>"Oh, to die, to die for him " thought Rostov.

>The Tsar said something more which Rostov did not hear, and the soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted "Hurrah!"

>Rostov too, bending over his saddle, shouted "Hurrah!" with all his might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if only to express his rapture fully.

>The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.

>"How can the Emperor be undecided?" thought Rostov, but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything else the Tsar did.

>That hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar's foot, in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp. Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at last only his white plumes were visible to Rostov from amid the suites that surrounded the Emperors.

>Among the gentlemen of the suite, Rostov noticed Bolkonski, sitting his horse indolently and carelessly. Rostov recalled their quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not to challenge Bolkonski. "Of course not!" he now thought. "Is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment? At a time of such love, such rapture, and such self-sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels and affronts matter? I love and forgive everybody now."

>When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began a ceremonial march past him, and Rostov on Bedouin, recently purchased from Denisov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadron- that is, alone and in full view of the Emperor.

>Before he reached him, Rostov, who was a splendid horseman, spurred Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the animal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperor's eye upon him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a high and graceful action, as if flying through the air without touching the ground.

>Rostov himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but blissful face "like a vewy devil," as Denisov expressed it.

>"Fine fellows, the Pavlograds!" remarked the Emperor.

>"My God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire this instant!" thought Rostov. (Tolstoy, *War and Peace*, Book 3, Chapter 8)






## History

> The concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperor's headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock. One wheel slowly moved, another was set in motion, and a third, and wheels began to revolve faster and faster, levers and cogwheels to work, chimes to play, figures to pop out, and the hands to advance with regular motion as a result of all that activity.   Just as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military machine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reached. Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to remain so for a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.   Just as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated human activities of 160,000 Russians and French- all their passions, desires, remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and enthusiasm- was only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the so-called battle of the three Emperors- that is to say, a slow movement of the hand on the dial of human history. (Tolstoy, War and Peace, Book 3, Chapter 11)



## Ethics

>“[Ethical problems] that are familiar in everyday discussions, and which range from idle bits of gossip about this or that man's character to prolonged and serious discussions of international politics” (1963a, v). C. L. Stevenson



## Genesis

> Let me hear and understand how in the beginning Thou made the heaven and the earth. Genesis 1:1 Moses wrote this; he wrote and departed—passed hence from You to You. Nor now is he before me; for if he were I would hold him, and ask him, and would adjure him by You that he would open unto me these things, and I would lend the ears of my body to the sounds bursting forth from his mouth. And should he speak in the Hebrew tongue, in vain would it beat on my senses, nor would anything touch my mind; but if in Latin, I should know what he said. But whence should I know whether he said what was true? But if I knew this even, should I know it from him? Verily within me, within in the chamber of my thought, Truth, neither Hebrew, nor Greek, nor Latin, nor barbarian, without the organs of voice and tongue, without the sound of syllables, would say, He speaks the truth, and I, immediately assured of it, confidently would say unto that man of Yours, You speak the truth. As, then, I cannot inquire of him, I beseech You—You, O Truth, full of whom he spoke truth—You, my God, I beseech, forgive my sins; and do Thou, who gave to that Your servant to speak these things, grant to me also to understand them.




## Nature, anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric

> "I have in mind here the classical view that the distinctive value of humanity lies in our possession of nous. Nous is standardly translated as ‘mind’ or ‘intellect,’ but it is important that these terms  be understood in a non-Cartesian way. Nous for the Greeks is something that exists in the cosmos  at large, independently of human thought. As such it is both the eternal Mind or Consciousness that orders the cosmos, and the rational structure of the cosmos that is eternally apprehended by this Mind. Variations of this view can be found in Anaxagoras, Plato (the Demiurge), Aristotle (the Prime Mover), the Stoics (the Logos), and Plotinus (Intellect).

> On this view, human nous is simply our local participation in the eternal divine Nous. In this respect the term nous functions more like ‘reason’ than ‘mind’; each of us partakes of Nous, but we do not collectively possess multiple nous-es (at least until Plotinus—although even his view, which posits a plurality of intellects, remains decidedly non-Cartesian). 

>Importantly, non-human nature also participates in Nous, although in a different way. It does so because processes of natural growth, development, and reproduction consist in the realization of natural forms, which in turn already exist in full actuality as the objects of the divine intellect.

>Any such natural process is thus a way in which nature participates, in a non-cognitive way, in the eternal actuality of Nous. This is a view that was adumbrated by Aristotle and developed systematically by Plotinus." (David Bradshaw)


## Prayer

1. "Seek the kingdom, by acquiring virtue, by praying, and hard work. In this way, acquire love, patience, peace, and become like God." -- Father Michael, St. George Orthodox Church, Hesperia





## Censorship, banning books

"One of the curious things about banning books is that the only way for you to have an opinion on whether the banning was a good idea or not is to read the book. Which you cannot do if it is banned. 

So you must delegate the reading of the banned book to someone else whose intellect and psyche is presumably less impressionable than yours, and then you must accept their opinion without question. 

This willing delegation of the power to police thought is the reason book banning and totalitarianism have appeared historically as two peas in a pod." [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/silencing-milo_us_586f3975e4b0eb9e49bfba52)



## Feminism

>Anti-feminism is the radical notion that women are adults. -- Karen Straughan
