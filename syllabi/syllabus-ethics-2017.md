### Description:
This course is an exercise in careful and deep thinking about morality, society, good, and evil. Each week will introduce a topic and encourage reflection on a literary or philosophical writing, which will be discussed in class. You will not only learn some new terms, concepts, and facts, but we will practice thinking philosophically about these topics and about our own lives. We will argue for and against significant truth claims, testing ourselves and the argument. In this way, we will not only think abstractly but may see our own moral failings, become more self-aware, more humble, and more moral.


### Goals:

* To practice thinking philosophically by examining, understanding, and critiquing complex arguments.
* To become familiar with major ethical theories, such as utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, commonsense intuition, divine command theory
* To reflect on our own lives, thoughts, and actions and become more virtuous, thoughtful, and wise human beings in the pursuit of goodness, truth, and beauty.

### Scope and Sequence:
The course is broken into 4 Units of 3-4 weeks each: 

- Unit 1. The Nature and Purpose of Morality (weeks 1, 2, 3) 
- Unit 2. Moral Theory (weeks 4, 5, 6, 7); 
- Unit 3, What is Worthwhile (weeks 8, 9, 10); and 
- Unit 4 Applied Ethics (weeks 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16).  

Each unit consists of three components. (1) Reading and weekly quizzes, (2) Discussion in class, (3) Writing. 

### Grades:
You will be graded on reading, participation, and papers, plus applicable extra credit. The best way to earn an 'A' is to read carefully, participate in and out of class, and write well.
