### Required Book: 

- [*The Moral Life*, Pojman and Vaughn (Fifth Edition)](http://amzn.to/2iFegft)

### Course Description:

This course introduces you to deeper and more careful thinking about morality, society, good, and evil. Each unit will introduce a topic and encourage reflection on a literary or philosophical writing, which will be discussed in class. Our goal will be to practice thinking philosophically about these topics and our own lives. Our goal will be to become better people, to see our own moral failings, and grow. 


### Learning Goals:

* To practice thinking philosophically by examining, understanding, and critiquing complex arguments.
* To become familiar with major ethical theories, such as utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, commonsense intuition, divine command theory
* To reflect on our own lives, thoughts, and actions and become more virtuous, thoughtful, and wise human beings in the pursuit of goodness, truth, and beauty.

### Scope and Sequence:

The course is broken into 6 Units of 2-3 weeks each: 

Each unit consists of four components. (1) Reading and daily quizzes, (2) Discussion in class, (3) Writing. Therefore, the best way to earn an 'A' is to read carefully, participate, and write. 


### Grades:

You will be graded primarily on reading, participation, and papers, plus applicable extra credit.
