> Buy the proper ISBNS only, please, because I assign page numbers *from these editions*.  Get physical books, not e-books, unless the cost is prohibitive.  New or used are both OK. You may purchase from any online retailer or physical bookstore, but the links provided are from Amazon (I participate in their affiliate program). Other handouts are provided for free online. 

### Course Description:
This course is an exercise in a different way of thinking: philosophical thinking. Strictly speaking, this is not an "introduction" to philosophical thinking -- because everybody already thinks this way *sometimes*. Rather, we will *exercise* it more. We will practice thinking philosophically. The method is to read and discuss philosophical writings and movies. In order to think philosophically, we will practice  read, discuss, and write about these texts. 

Our topics will be eclectic: origins, myth, Socrates, happiness, evil, the soul, God, and human nature. Some of these questions are more abstract, some are more practical -- all of them are windows into a reality beyond the day-to-day. 

There are no long lectures; every class period will consist of *dialog* together. Philosophical thinking cannot be programed into you; you must take responsibility for dialogging in class and out of class. 

There *are* answers. Philosophy is not just about questions. But there are no *easy* answers. You will be confused, at points. And the answers we will find will only come after hard work. So enjoy the ride. Ask questions. Get frustrated. Doodle. Guess. Take risks. 

The ultimate motivation for having the conversation we call philosophy must be that it can make us better. We enter into the Great Conversation with our own, often confused, thoughts. We may learn to love God with our minds. We may become more connected, integrated, thoughtful, reflective human beings. We may become part of the Conversation, and by it be forever changed. 


### Learning Goals:

* To practice thinking philosophically. 
* To understand difficult and complex arguments.
* To become familiar with the thought of Greek and Medieval philosophers such as Plato and Augustine.
* To understand, test, and defend the Christian worldview.
* To reflect on our own lives, thoughts, and actions.
* To become more virtuous, thoughtful, and wise human beings in the pursuit of goodness, truth, and beauty.

### Scope, Sequence, and Grades:

The course is broken into 6 Units of 2-3 weeks each: Origins, Socrates, Forms, Logic, God, and Human Nature. Each unit consists of four components. (1) Reading and daily quizzes, (2) Discussion in class, (3) Writing. Therefore, the best way to earn an 'A' is to read carefully, participate, and write. 

You will be graded primarily on reading, participation, and papers, plus applicable extra credit.
