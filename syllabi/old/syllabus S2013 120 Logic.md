#### Spring 2013, Introduction to Logic  (PDF version)

**Instructor:** Keith Buhler     
**Email:** keith.buhler@uky.edu      
**Twitter:** keith_buhler    
**Office Hours:** Monday, Wednesday, 12-1pm; after class; by appointment     
**Sections**: 10 and 11, 8am and 9am, MWF  
**Text:** Hurley. A Concise Introduction to Logic, 11th  ed. (custom).  [ISBN: 1133304737]

### Description:

Introductory logic deals with arguments. Arguments are the best way (along with careful observation) to get at truth. Particularly, you will learn how to identify the conclusion of an argument, identify the premise(s), and evaluate the inference. You will distinguish deductive from inductive reasoning, test formal arguments, calculate probability, evaluate inductive arguments, and avoid common reasoning errors. The ultimate goal is to think and argue well in your discipline. Clear communication is the most desired job skill. Successful people and great leaders know how to make good arguments and dismantle bad arguments.  


### Goals

Since this class is a Philosophy class and also part of the UK Core (Quantitative Foundations), upon completing the course, students will be able to:

- identify arguments (premise and conclusion) 
- build arguments for truth claims 
- analyze and critique arguments making truth claims 
- apply logical concepts to solving real world problems. 
- translate plain-language arguments into symbolic form, and from symbolic form to plain-language 
- build truth tables 
- construct symbolic proofs 
- evaluate arguments involving statistics 
- avoid common logical fallacies 
- understand the kinds of arguments your own discipline makes 


### Grades

Exam I:                        20%

Exam II:                       20%

Exam III (Final):          30%

Class participation:      10%

Quizzes:                       20%                    



Grading Scale: 

A = 100% - 90%       C = 79% - 70%

B = 89% - 80%         D = 69% - 60%      F = &lt; 59%

1. How to Succeed in this class 
  

1. Grading 
    1. The best way to get an “A” is to master the material. This means attending class each week, studying for quizzes, taking advantage of office hours, and being an active participant in class, and mastering the material before the tests.   
    2. I will administer 3 tests and (approximately) one quiz per week based on the lecture and book material. The tests make up 70% of the grade, the quizzes make up 25%, while the other 5% is simply attendance and participation.  
    3. Speak up in class. Ask questions, interrupt, bring examples. Take responsibility for your education!  

  

1. Class time 
    1. Class time will be divided between lecture, discussion, and practice exercises. 
    2. As you read and study, please write down your questions or make a mental note. Bring them up in our discussions.  
    3. 5% of your grade depends solely on being active in class. This participation is your responsibility; I may not call on you. Do not distract yourself with side conversations, texting, or doing anything else in class.  
    4. Bring paper and a pen or pencil and your textbook to every class, as we’ll be doing logic exercises privately or corporately.  

  

1. Respect 
    1. This means paying attention in class to the instructor and your fellow classmates. Show others respect and you will be respected in turn.  
    2. Listen attentively, don’t make side conversation or say excessive frivolous comments.  
    3. Be polite in your emails to me and in your comments to your fellow students.  
    4. Unkindness, even in the form of jokes and teasing, will not be tolerated.  
    5. Come to class on time, but don’t leave (or pack up) before we’re done.   
    6. Introductory Logic is a no electronic device zone—that means no cell phones, iPads, blackberries, Androids, or laptops, to name a few. Pacemakers, however, are acceptable.   

  

1. Absences 
    1. Class time is the foundation of your learning this material. More than 4 unexcused absences will result in a 50% deduction of the grade. 6 absences (even if some are excused!) will result in a smaller 10% deduction. 
    2. If you have an excused absence, please let me know by email beforehand (if possible) you won’t be attending, or provide me with a copy (that I may keep!) of evidence for your excused absence, i.e. a doctor’s note. 
    3. Quizzes (mostly on Mondays) missed due to unexcused absences cannot be made up.   
    4. Two absences will not count against you. 

  

1. Promptness 
    1. We have limited time together and we will make use of every minute. Please be on time (or 60 seconds early) so as to hear important announcements, comments, and exercises. 
    2. Quizzes will be administered at the beginning of class with sufficient time allotted; no extra time will be given to late students. 
    3. Repeated tardiness will constitute an absence.  

  

1. Workload 
    1. Expect a minimum of five hours per week outside of class to read the material and practice exercises and studying for quizzes.  
    2. Everyone will struggle with some portion of this class. It’s hard. Come see me in office hours or visit the Study or both.  

  

1. Academic Integrity  
    1. Do not take anyone else’s work nor provide your work to anyone else (under whatever auspices). 
    2. A healthy sense of intellectual honor is necessary for succeeding in academics, and this class is no exception. Cheating robs other students not only of a fair grade but also fundamentally threatens the mission of this institution of higher education. Thus, we have instituted a zero tolerance policy.  
    3. If it is determined that a student has cheated, all students involved will receive a grade of zero for the class. If the case is egregious, I will direct the case to the appropriate University Dean for official rebuke.  

  

1. Communicate with me.  
    1. Email me anytime but only between 8am-5pm Monday – Friday, or as I’m available. Include your full name and section number (I teach three sections, so I want to get your identity straight). I’ll try to respond within one business day.    

 In order to receive accommodations in this course, you must me with a Letter of Accommodation from the [Disability Resource Center](http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/DisabilityResourceCenter/). If you have not already done so, please register with the Disability Resource Center (Room 2 Alumni Gym, 257-2754, [jkarnes@uky.edu](mailto:jkarnes@uky.edu?subject=Coordination%20of%20Disability%20Services%20(PHI120)) or 859-257-2754).) for coordination of campus disability services available to students with disabilities.

1. Also, everyoneshould take advantage of office hours—and not just before midterms or exams. If you ask me “How do I get an ‘A’?” the answer will always be, “Master the material.”  
2. Call or Skype during office hours or by appointment for any question, big or small, about this course.  
3. For short, quick questions, try sending me a direct message on Twitter.  
4. If you don’t get an email response from me within in 48 hours, try emailing me a quick reminder “Still waiting or your response;” I am teaching this section but taking my own classes too.  Or simply come by during office hours—you’re sure to catch me there. 
  

1. Enjoy logic. The imperative “Enjoy logic,” (much like “enjoy math!” or “enjoy public speaking!” may sound to some like the command “Enjoy paper cuts!” or “Enjoy banging your shin against a coffee table!” But it is possible. Not only the content, which is fascinating, but the “puzzle-solving” factor of the process of making arguments and breaking down arguments can be a real mental thrill. The more you and your fellows allow yourselves to acquire a “taste” for the material, the more inclined you will be to give it the real effort required to master it. Remember that you’re hear not just to master these concepts for a test (that too), but because the mental fitness you acquire will last well beyond the semester’s end.
