### Required Readings 
- [*Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics*, Brenkert & Beauchamp](http://amzn.to/1ThV3ew) Oxford, 2010. First Edition. Available at UK bookstore and online.

### Course Description
Some of the toughest decisions we make have to do with business and money. As employees, managers, business owners, and even as consumers, we buy, use, create, or recycle the products of business. This course helps us to think philosophically about business, capitalism and wealth, fairness, social justice, product safety, bribery and lobbying, globalization and trade, privacy and whistle blowing. We may branch out to related tangents including logic, public policy, anthropology, religion, law, and more. 

Ethics is a branch of philosophy. So we will also reflect on the basics of right and wrong. We will practice deep and careful thinking about fundamental topics and apply such thinking to business: what is worthwhile? Who is truly successful? What is private property? 

Although each of us comes to this course from their own moral tradition and background, we will challenge ourselves and others with respect, understanding ourselves better, and disagreeing respectfully. We will clarify our terms, evaluate arguments for and against reasonable positions and come to our own conclusions. 

Despite the abstractness of these topics, the ultimate objective is that we can act well when hard decisions come. 

### Course Goals 

* to understand business as part of life, and part of ethics, public policy, and philosophy
* to become familiar with major ethical theories, especially: virtue ethics, utilitarianism, and deontology 
* to understand our own ethical tradition better and that of others
* to grow intellectually by critically analyzing articles, books, studies, and news articles about business
* and thereby to become more virtuous people capable of handling difficult life circumstances.

### Course Structure
