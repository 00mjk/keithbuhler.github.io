### Required Readings 
- [*Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics*, Brenkert & Beauchamp](http://amzn.to/1ThV3ew) Oxford, 2010. First Edition. Available at UK bookstore and online.

### Course Description
Some of the toughest decisions we make have to do with making money working in a business or running a business. We will make tough decisions as employees, professionals, managers, investors, or entrepreneurs; even as consumers we will "vote with our dollars" when we buy product, use, re-use, and recycle. 

This course helps us to think philosophically about business, wealth, fairness, social justice, politics, trade, payment, and work. The objective is that we can act well when hard decisions come. 

When we conduct business, our whole world view is engaged.Philosophy in general asks questions about what is real, how we know what we know. It is on a continuum with investigations into science, mathematics, religion, and literature.  

Ethics is the branch of philosophy that investigates right and wrong, good and bad. What is worthwhile or worthless and how to live a worthwhile life. What is good? Who is truly enviable? So, in business ethics, we ask about foundations: What is a good business? What is success? What is private and public property? Are there constraints on products and services one can provide? 

These questions and more we will attempt to answer by clarifying terms, establishing secure ethical principles, being sensitive to contextual details, identifying reasonable answers, evaluating arguments for and against each reasonable answer, and coming to our own conclusions. Though we will consider arguments from Kantian, consequentialist, and religious standpoints, our official approach to these questions will be from the standpoint of traditional virtue ethics.

Each of us belongs to a tradition and a community. Our goal is to understand our own tradition and understand rival traditions, and why they disagree. We will disagree, but do so peaceably and with understanding. 

The bottom line is always to think hard about hard questions, to discard wrong answers and discover and prove right answers to these questions. The hard questions will revolve around business, wealth, justice, safety, information, incentives, globalization, etc. but may branch out to related tangents including logic, public policy, anthropology, religion, law, and more. 

### Course Goals 

* to understand business as part of life
* to understand business as part of applied ethics, public policy, and as a sub-discipline of ethical philosophy
* to become familiar with major ethical theories, especially: virtue ethics, utilitarianism, and deontology 
* to grow intellectually by critically analyzing articles, books, studies, and news articles about business
* to understand our own ethical tradition better and make clear plans for how to make hard decisions
* Also to understand the tradition of others (religious ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics) in approaching ethical issues;
* and thereby to become more virtuous people capable of handling difficult life circumstances.

### Course Structure

To accomplish our course goals, the semester is broken into 8 units of 1-2 weeks each. Each Unit consists of (a) readings and quizzes, (b) lectures, (c) discussions, and (d) a unit paper. The readings and lectures offer analysis, the discussions and papers synthesis. 

### Grading
