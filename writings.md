# Writings #

I am a devout amateur. I believe you should write and create lots of different things even if you can't or don't or don't want to make money with them. Just create. So here are some articles, short stories, fairy tales, screenplays, and satire. 

You can read some of my writings below. 

My non-academic writings *have* been published on line and in print at MereOrthodoxy, The Examined Life, the London School of Training, The Word, and others. 

The most important thing I'm writing right now is my [dissertation](http://circularreason.github.io/phd). I also created the [Intentional Reading Project](http://www.readingintentionally.com/)  The goal is to help you define your reading goals and achieve them.
