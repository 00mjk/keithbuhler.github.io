# INcompleteness of physics

Is physics "complete"? I do not think so. But the question as phrased is ambiguous. 

Here is an important question we should step back and ask: is the question of the completeness of physics a question of physics or not? Take an analogy. Suppose someone is really into soccer. He plays soccer professionally, plays soccer video games, teaches his kids soccer, and so on. He also knows all the rules of soccer, inside and out. When he watches a game he can tell you when a player should have received a yellow card and when the referee was wrong. Now suppose you are discussing the "completeness of soccer." He says soccer is the only game in the world, but you think there are some other great games like (American) football, rugby, lacrosse, and whatever. He thinks you are merely superstitious. His proof that soccer is complete is that the rule book states only soccer rules and states nothing whatsoever about any other game. 

This example shows that the "rules" within a system do not (and perhaps cannot in principle) comment on any world outside the system. The completeness of soccer cannot be proven from within the world of soccer. It's an absurd example, but that's the point: no one makes the mistake of thinking soccer is literally the only sport in the world. No fan is that fanatical. 

Similarly, no one within the physical universe can judge whether the physical universe is all there is simply by cataloging and examining the list of physical rules. The "physical rules" in this case are, of course, natural laws. A complete descriptive set of natural laws, expressed mathematically or in natural language, would say nothing about what might or might not exist outside the set. 

That leads us to a second point: people have opinions about the completeness of physics. People disagree about it. Suppose physics were complete, and there were nothing outside the physical world. How would anyone have an opinion about it? The advocate of the completeness of physics will argue that human superstition gives rise to a host of fanciful weeds that scientific thinking cuts down.
