One of the most painful things we can do in life is sort through past emotions. Big emotions do not "go away" with time. They only go away with attention. They have a life cycle, like the weather. Emotions evaporate when we feel them. Children do this instinctually -- they cry as long (and as hard) as they need to to feel the feeling, then they are done. 

This post is not about emotions -- not directly. This post is about clutter. It's about "stuff." One of the most painful things I have ever done is sorting through past stuff. In my childhood, I saw a lot of people crippled by the inability to throw things away, give them away, make them useful, or get rid of them. My adult life has been a slow, painful, process of unclenching my fist and getting rid of things: artwork, clothes, batteries, papers, bills, knick-knacks, picture frames, books, notes from college, journals, shoes, hats, food, boxes, computer files, videos, CDs. 

These two -- sorting through feelings and sorting through stuff -- are related. 

"Clutter is unmade decisions." (paraphrasing Christina Scalize) I would add that clutter is unprocessed emotion. 

A stubborn pile that refused to be organized, put away, thrown away represents a pile of emotion that has to be *felt.* The same probably goes for stubborn pounds that refuse to go away.  Extra weight on the body and extra stuff around the house are spiritually identical. 

Health comes from eating what you need (no more) and eating what is good for you (less junk) and burning it all off with healthy and enjoyable activity. 

After an exhausting cross-country move in 2012, Lindsay and I got rid of a lot of stuff. We stored some stuff at our parents house, and brought a SINGLE MINIVAN's worth of stuff to Kentucky. (We bought furniture once we arrived.) While in Kentucky, we lived light for 5 years. When we moved back in 2017, I decided it was time to go nuclear. I threw away almost everything. I gathered all of our stuff from storage, parents houses, childhood homes, and put it in one place and slowly went through it. 

It almost killed me but I gave away about 20% of my books -- those I could admit to myself that I would probably never open them again (or that I could re-purchase if need be.) 

A couple of maxims have motivated my journey. First, Fr. Josiah Trenham says "the possession is justified by use." If you don't use it, you may not be justified in owning it. Second, St. John Chrysostem says that "whatever you don't use belongs to the poor." By thinking this way, I have slimmed down... slowly but surely, for the last 8 years. 

*“Clutter is the physical manifestation of unmade decisions fueled by procrastination.”
