# Writing Tools #

As an academic and writer, I enjoy exploring new software and workflow processes. Nothing is wrong with using Microsoft Word or Apple Pages or Google Drive; at the end of the day, I need a reliable set of tools with which to capture and publish thoughts. 

But there are many innovative tools and methods that have the potential to unlock your imagination and productivity. Here are a few tools I have used or use regularly. (This post is periodically updated: first update, July 2016)

I organize this post from Easy to Hard. 


## Easy (Software) ##

* [Google Drive (Formerly Google Docs)](https://drive.google.com/) I rate Drive as 5/5 Easiness, and 3/5 Usefulness. Google Drive started out as an alternative to Dropbox in that it mirrors itself from your hard drive onto the cloud. (And every file change is auto-synced.) Pretty soon though, the market got crowded in the cloud backup business. So Google added Docs, Sheets, Forms, Slides, and Drawings apps to make the utility indispensable. "Docs" is 10x better than Word or Pages; Sheets is 10x easier and more intuitive than Excel; Slides is 10x simpler and more intuitive than Powerpoint or Keynote, and Drawing is 10x better than "Microsoft Paint". And *all* these files are automatically in the cloud. I've used Slides, for example, in my [philosophy](/teaching) classrooms or conferences across the country and never have to bother with thumb drives or plugging in my own laptop or any of that nonsense. Furthermore, nothing in the Office Suite that I've used corresponds to Google Forms, which I've used to create surveys for class and [for fun.](http://keithbuhler.com/cs-lewis-influence-survey) Drive does almost everything I need it to do. 
* [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php). Ease 3/5, Usefulness, 4/5. Scrivener is the best all-around writing software I know of. It is useful for academic work, fiction, novels, screenplays, you name it. You write in plain text and "compile" (export) to .Docx for further editor or you can compile straight to PDF. Beautiful. It's $40 and worth $400. The initial pay-out of time spent learning how to make Scrivener go is very slim, maybe a day or two. But I've spent years unfolding new discoveries. I've written the first two or three drafts of my [dissertation](/phd) in Scrivener and could not have done so without it.

### Why Write in Markdown? ###

If you are ready to take your writing to the next level, consider Markdown. Markdown allows you to write in plain text but "code" the formatting into the content. For example, a hashtag "#" becomes a heading, and "##" becomes a subtitle, and a word wrapped in asterices "*" becomes *italic*. 

    # heading
    ## sub-heading
    *italic*

Why do this? A couple reasons. First, consider how much time you have spent over a lifetime formatting your writing. Whether it's academic papers, poems, essays, stories, screenplays, web pages, resumes, or anything else, formatting takes forever. The longer the project, the more time is soaked up in formatting. 

* [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) is a nice "online version" of Mou or Markdown. It's very pared down, but the benefit is you don't have to download the hefty Macdown to get started.  If you write in Markdown, or want to learn, this site is an easy way to instantly preview your Markdown code. 
* [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) was the original markdown utility. Still simple, light, and customizable. 
* [Macdown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) is a very similar markdown program. I like it a bit better than Mou, but both will help you get your feet wet. The live-preview option is essential to learning the basics. 
* [Texts.io](http://www.texts.io/) is a wonderful simple utility for writing in Markdown. Ease 2/5, Usefulness 4/5. The idea here is to code in Markdown, exporting to .docx or PDF. The display is beautiful, clean, minimal plain text with light WYSIWYG mark up. Also, it's free. Requires about 30-90 minutes to learn Markdown syntax and become comfortable with it.

### Web Markdown Utilities  ###


* [HTML to Markdown](https://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/) Converts web pages to Markdown. Convert your current HTML webpage to markdown, or see how other pages would look. 

* [Table to Markdown](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) Convert tables to Markdown and vice versa. 



## Hard 

+ For L33T h@ckerz: I recommend Sublime Text (3), Pandoc, Bibdesk, and PDFLatex -- all free but requires SOME programming competence. I am working on simple written instructions with accompanying video. Once you get it down it makes beautiful, lovely, amazing, awesomely formatted papers. 

## Web Utilities ##

* [Word Count Tool](https://wordcounter.net/)
* [Words to pages](http://wordstopages.com/). This tool helps you estimate how many pages your paper will be, how long it will take to read outloud (useful for presentations), how long it will take to read, etc. 

* [Simple Writer](https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/). This playful tool from Randall Munroe of [xkcd fame](http://www.xkcd.com/) helps you write using only the 1000 most common words. A good exercise for testing how well you understand a thing.
