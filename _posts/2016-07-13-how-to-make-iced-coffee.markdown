It's summertime now, so caffiene addicts like myself sometimes don't want a steamy cup of joe. We'd rather enjoy a cool, refreshing glass of iced coffee. 

Why not make your own? Starbucks be darned. 

I've been perfecting my iced coffee recipe for more than 15 minutes now and I'll pass it along to you. 

1. Brew a pot of hot coffee. 
2. Pour coffee in a glass, and ddd milk.
4. Add ice to cool it down.
5. Wait until the ice melts.
6. Still hot? Add more ice.
7. Sip. It's 50% water now, so it probably tastes bad.
9. Add sugar. 
10. Sip again. Still bad? Pour it out.
12. Brew another pot of hot coffee.
13. Drink the hot coffee.

Enjoy!
