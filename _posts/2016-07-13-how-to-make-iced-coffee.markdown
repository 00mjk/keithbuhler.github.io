title: How to make Iced Coffee

It's summertime now, so caffiene addicts like myself sometimes don't want a steamy cup of joe. We'd rather enjoy a cool, refreshing glass of iced coffee. You can pay $8 at Starbucks or you can make your own! I've been perfecting my iced coffee recipe for more than 15 minutes now and I'll pass it along to you. 

1. Brew a pot of hot coffee. 
2. Pour it in a glass.
3. Add milk.
4. Add ice to cool it down.
5. Wait until the ice melts.
6. Add more ice.
7. Sip the coffee.
8. It's 50% water now, so it probably tastes bad.
9. Add sugar. 
10. Sip again. Still bad.
11. Pour it out.
12. Brew another pot of hot coffee.
13. Drink the hot coffee.

Enjoy!
