# How to read the news

## 3 kinds of bias you can't avoid

1. [Selection bias](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Selection_bias) -- a kind of ommission
2. [Framing bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology))
3. "Spin" (expression bias?) -- using certain words to suggest a particular claim on reality without making the claim explicitly. "Emphasizing aspects of a policy favorable to liberals without noting aspects favorable to conservatives; putting out the liberal interpretation of what an event means while giving little or no time or space to explaining the conservative interpretation."



## 2 strategies for overcome bias

1. Compare equal and opposite biases.  Red and white together, not pink (quote Chesterton). Twitter, Facebook are echo chambers! You can't get the other side there.
2. Reflect on your own selection, framing, and spin. What is noteworthy to you? What would you have put in, left out? What do you really want to know?
