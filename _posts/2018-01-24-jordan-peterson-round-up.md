Remember that one time Jordan Peterson [spent 20-30 uncomfortable but productive minutes being interviewed by British journalist Cathy Newman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=61&v=aMcjxSThD54) and his [book shot to #1 on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2DSKqSQ)?

If you have 30 minutes to spare... the video will edify and or decimate you.

Among my favorite highlights from this interview are the underrated: 

- "Grow the hell up." and
- "Women deeply want men who are competent." 

Newman now knows that you don't mess with the well-researched, well-spoken psychologist who actually knows people from his decades in clinical psychology unless you have cards to compete.

If you're just hearing about JBP, he's a real psychologist with a clinical practice, lots of published research on religion, mythology, psychology and more, as well as a popularizer and pundit. Don't let anyone define him into a box for you, too quickly. Get to know him.

I've been enjoying Peterson's YouTube content for a while now. There's a lot of it, far more than I have seen. He's more than just a pundit on sexual politics. For example, [he explains why your path to enlightenment goes down through the darkest parts of you, the places you least want to see, acknowledge, and tackle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fesSvXKxYd0&feature=youtu.be) 

Lately, Peterson's "book tour" consists of simply going on television, saying true things simply and forcefully, receiving insane backlash, and creating internet culture. 

- [One filmmaker mashed up all the times Cathy Newman told Peterson what he was saying](Being interviewed = saying X, being asked if you're saying Y, asserting that you're not saying Y, but X.)
- [Freedom tunes followed up their original JBP fable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUdxCj7IKCY) with [another one satirizing the Newman interview.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU8IJE7Vthk)


That said, some serious think pieces have been written as well. Two good ones.

- [David Brooks at NYT says Peterson's advice (in *12 Rules for Life*) is "exhortatory banality".](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/opinion/jordan-peterson-moment.html)
- [Douglas Murray at the Spectator says that Peterson's live speech was "wonderful."](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/01/the-curious-star-appeal-of-jordan-peterson/)

Enjoy!
