The interview between Jordan Peterson and Cathy Newman of Channel 4 is a must see.   

If you have 30 minutes to spare... the video will edify and/or decimate you.

Awesome. 

<br> 
 
Among my favorite highlights from this interview are the underrated lines: 

- "Grow the hell up." and
- "Women deeply want men who are competent." 

<br> 

In my view, Newman tussled with a well-researched, well-spoken psychologist who actually knows people from his decades in clinical psychology. She wasn't prepared for calm, well-reasoned answers delivered in a friendly manner. 

She looked like she was piling up straw men. She helped increase his fame.


## The Reactions

Lately, Peterson's "book tour" consists of simply going on television, saying true things simply and forcefully, receiving insane backlash, and creating internet culture. 

There have been serious and not-so-serious reactions. 


## Some think piece reactions to the Newman interview

## Introducing Jordan Peterson

If you're just hearing about JBP, don't let anyone define him into a box for you, too quickly. 

Get to know him.

<!--more-->

He's a clinical and academic psychologist. He has spent years in clinical practice and published widely influential research on religion, mythology, and psychology. 

More recently, he's become a YouTube content creator and political commentator. 

I've been enjoying Peterson's YouTube content for a while now. There's a lot of it, far more than I have seen. He's more than just a pundit on sexual politics. For example, [he explains why your path to enlightenment goes down through the darkest parts of you, the places you least want to see, acknowledge, and tackle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fesSvXKxYd0&feature=youtu.be)
