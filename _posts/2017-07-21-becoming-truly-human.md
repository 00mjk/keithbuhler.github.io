Check out this new documentary by Nathan Jacobs. It will hit your interest on multiple levels -- if you are religious, or not religious, or formerly religious, or simply curious about trends in American life. 

I've seen the film and it is beautifully moving in ways that reveal more about the heights, and depths, of being human.
