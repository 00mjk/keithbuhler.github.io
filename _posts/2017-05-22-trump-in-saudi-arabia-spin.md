Listening to [Trump's speech in Saudi Arabia](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-administration/334454-full-speech-president-donald-trump-address-in-saudi), and watching all the pomp and circumstance... It's all very interesting. First, it makes me glad I'm not a politician. I'm too ADD to sit through all that.

More interesting, though, is trying to imagine how the current President's political enemies are going to try to spin this. I can't do it yet, but I'm sure it will happen.

Somehow, and I'm not sure how, there will be news stories presenting some or all parts of his speech, some or all his actions unstable, crazy, undisciplined, unfit, and of course in collusion with Russia.

### Guesses

Maybe they'll highlight how Trump talked about "his people" (the US) in parallel with King Solomon's "people", thus implying that Trump is a king? Maybe they'll take offense to his using the word "extremism" or, the opposite, failing to use the word "Islamic extremism"? Maybe they'll call it patronizing that he complained (and rightly so) about the fact that the majority of victims of Islamist terrorism are themselves Muslim? Or maybe something else I can't even imagine yet... 

Or maybe, if there is not a good spin to be spun, the trip will be ignored in favor of other issues (Isreal perhaps?) that can be spun negatively.

I'm all for criticizing our president's many, many flaws; as I will be for criticizing the flaws of our next slate of candidates. But I'm against the concerted campaign to exaggerate these people's flaws and minimize their strengths. I'm for honesty and balance.
