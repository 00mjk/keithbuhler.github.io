## Thursday, 11:10am -- John Mark Reynolds "Avoiding the Temptation of Christian Leninism" 

![john mark](/images/rr4.JPG)

John Mark is talking about the cultural shifts that happen about on the 70 year marks. 

He suggests that if we lose, we must lose cheerfully. And if we win, we must win cheerfully. 

Saruman's temptation is to compromise to win. The Utopian temptation is to *never* compromise, and to throw reality under the bus. Christians are utopian in the sense that we pray "thy kingdom come" and mean it; we are waiting for the King. In the mean time, however, it is easy to see that his kingdom is not of this world. 

Although Christians might be tempted to illicit utopianism, we are more often tempted to Leninism: "By any means necessary." Leninism compromises its message by its method. 

The tool shapes the soul of the person using it. Those who perpetrated the white terror in Russia became impotent to form an effective Russian existence in exile because they had lost their moral authority. 

Christian schools compromise when they use "Great Books" but don't use "The Great Book", the Bible. Or when they are dishonest about their achievements. Or when they use Bible verses out of context like "the fool says in his heart, 'there is no god.'" To exaggerate and lose our integrity.

## Thursday, 10:10am -- Tim Griffith "Teaching Meaning in Language"

*For this session, I had to choose a path. I chose a presentation having to do with teaching language because I'll be teaching Ancient Greek in fall 2017.* 

BRIGADE ROOM: [Tim Griffiths](http://www.nsa.edu/academics/faculty/timothy-l-griffith/) is a Latin teacher at [New Saint Andrew's College](http://www.nsa.edu/). He is talking to us about teaching *meaning*, rather than simple translation of "equus" to "horse" in another language like Latin. 

He's taught many age-levels and grades, from children, to middle and high school, to college, including adult learners. 

He says that most people teach meaning by offering "English equivalence." For example, the teacher might say "Amo" means "I love". The student feels comfortable, the teacher feels competent. 

But "amare" in Latin has all the worst connotations of love, the kinds of love Ovid likes to write about. 

He says Latin dictionaries were written by Englishman in the 1700s.

Some words have changed: "Corn" in 18th century English meant "grain". 

"Phero" means "bear" (as in "carry") but "bear" is becoming archaic. 

Latin has no word for an "owl". We have an idea of owl, a class of birds, that hoot, that look the same within a range. Latin has a bunch of words for various classes of birds. 

"Aquila" applies to eagles but also vultures and raptors. 

"Lentus" means "slow, sticky, flexible." 

"Quinam" doesn't mean anything in Latin, it has a *use*. "of course" or "yes" or "indeed". Really, it is used to underline emphasis. 

"Puer" means "boy" -- or "child" (or sometimes "slave", in Cicero, for example.)

What's the solution? 

Switch the order. Teach them some English, and ask them "How would you say that in Latin?" You teach the concept or concept cluster first (using English) and then attach the Latin words. 

"Boat" can be a vessel, large or small, and a verb "to boat". There are Latin words for each of those concepts. "Chaffe"(sp?) = small boat; navus = boat; navigare = to boat or navigate. 

To teach the dative, he presents a situation, where we talk about the indirect object for 10 minutes, then show how to do Latin. Then try to use it. 

"Ecce" does something -- it doesn't just *mean* 'behold'. It could also mean, listen, pay attention.

## Thursday, 9:30am -- Break -- Douglas Wilson and Courtney Palumbo

I ran into Douglas Wilson and he was gracious enough to grant me an interview. I didn't have a cameraman so it was a "selfie" interview... I'll post that as soon as I get it edited. 

I also ran into my friend Courtney Palumbo of [Regents School in Charlottesville](http://regents-school.org/). Check out the amazing things they are doing there in Virginia.

## Thursday, 8:30am -- George Grant "Reformation and Revolution"


![grant](/images/rr2.JPG)


[George Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Grant_(author)) is speaking about the connection between two historical events: Protestant Reformation and the Association of Classical and Christian Schools. This is year marks the 500th anniversary of the Reformation and the 25th anniversary of the ACCS.

Grant is eloquently contrasting reformation with revolution; revolutions like the French revolution, the Prussian revolution, Bolshevik revolution, and our own sexual and cultural revolution aim for quick fixes by razing to the ground centuries of tradition. Reformation is a slow, steady, faithfulness in one direction intended to restore a lost tradition. 

(While the Catholic, Orthodox, and high church Anglicans in the audience might be less-than-enthusiastic about the Reformation, Grant's definition of restoring tradition sits well with this Orthodox Christian. Regardless, Grant is playing to the majority crowd of Protestants.)

Grant summarizes the life of Luther and Calvin and the apparently insignificant achievements of the first pioneers of the movement. 

He argues from the French author Domine(sp?) there are four phases of a movement: 

1. Pioneers -- jeremiads, fulminations, controversies (Luther)
2. Foundations -- Nehemiahs, depth, pastoral care, dogmatics (Calvin)
3. Institutional -- financial and administrative stabilization, political interests, mainstreaming, also a faltering of clarity, a mission drift (?)
4. Maturity -- a return to the pioneers and foundations, a rediscovery of the substance of the earlier days, characterized by real humility (Puritains)

Many ACCS schools are in phases 1-3. Our challenge, Grant says, is to find our way through this circuitous route to the maturity phase. 

Grant says that genuine education is always a form of repentance. 

We must strive for *semper reformanda*, constant reformation. We have received a stockpile of goodness, truth, and beauty. It takes humility to hold that securely, to hold it precious. 

Grant notes that some in the audience are tired, weary, and who are giving classical education "one more shot." He quips that "maybe it's time for, I don't know, the Benedict Option." But all we have to do to change the world is just "the next right thing."

## Thursday, 8:15am -- Orientation

The ACCS administration hosted a playful "metaphor contest", awarding rhetoric books to the student who could craft the most poignant, funny, insightful, and surprising metaphor in a single sentence. The winner was: 

>"His excuse for being late was like his toupee; patchy, inadequate, and not fooling anyone."

## Thursday, 8:10am -- Vendors

![clt](/images/rr5.JPG)

There are also venders a-plenty. 

I met Kirby from [CLT](https://www.cltexam.com/), the "Classic Learning Test", a relatively new alternative and competitor to the SAT/ACT. I've heard of the test and already found it intriguing, but Kirby closed the sale. I'm buying a student study guide to pitch to my administrators at my school.

## Thursday, 8:00am -- First Impressions

![panorama](/images/rr3.JPG)

Looks like an impressive turn out. More than 500, I'd guess around 1,000 attendees. 

The younger folks manning the conference registration table ACCS staff, and college students from Grove City College and other classical colleges. Everything is professionally done.

## Thursday, 6:00am -- Airport

![airport selfie](/images/rr1.JPG)


I caught some shut-eye on the overnight flight but it wasn't the best night of sleep in my life. Feeling a little upside down.  

It's 3am to my body, but I've freshened up and changed at the airport. Headed to Pittsburgh and the Wyndham Grand Hotel!

##  Interviews

Update: Doctors Markos and George, and Andrew Kern have agreed to do interviews. Should be fun! Also, I was able to catch Douglas Wilson for a few questions.
