I'll be attending the [2017 Repairing the Ruins](http://2017.repairingtheruins.org/) conference in Pittsburgh. 

The conference is put on by the Association of Classical Christian Schools and is the largest such conference in the country. There will be sessions on the big ideas and practical details of classical education in our context today.

If all goes well, I'll be live-blogging some of the conference sessions as well as interviewing some of the speakers and participants. 

Stay tuned!
