*I'll be attending the [2017 Repairing the Ruins](http://2017.repairingtheruins.org/) conference in Pittsburgh. The conference is put on by the [Association of Classical Christian Schools](https://classicalchristian.org/) and is the largest such conference in the country. There will be sessions on the big ideas and practical details of classical education in our context today. Stay tuned for updates below.*

## Thursday, 8:30am -- George Grant

[George Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Grant_(author)) is speaking about the connection between two historical events: Protestant Reformation and the Association of Classical and Christian Schools. This is year marks the 500th anniversary of the Reformation and the 25th anniversary of the ACCS. 

Grant is eloquently contrasting reformation with revolution; revolutions like the French revolution, the Prussian revolution, Bolshevik revolution, and our own sexual and cultural revolution aim for quick fixes by razing to the ground centuries of tradition. Reformation is a slow, steady, faithfulness in one direction intended to restore a lost tradition. 

He summarized the life of Luther and Calvin and the apparently insignificant achievements of the first pioneers of the movement. 

He argues from Domine(sp?) there are four phases of a movement: 

1. Pioneers -- jeremiads, fulminations, controversies (Luther)
2. Foundations -- Nehemiahs, depth, pastoral care, dogmatics (Calvin)
3. Institutional -- financial and administrative stabilization, political interests, mainstreaming

## Thursday, 8:00am -- Orientation

The ACCS administration hosted a playful "metaphor contest", awarding rhetoric books to the student who could craft the most poignant, funny, insightful, and surprising metaphor in a single sentence. The winner was: 

>"His excuse for being late was like his toupee; patchy, inadequate, and not fooling anyone."
