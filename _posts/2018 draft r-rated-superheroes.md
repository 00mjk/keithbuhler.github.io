[Movieguide reports](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/dawn-r-rated-superhero-movie.html) on the dawn of the R-Rated Superhero movie. 

It's official. 

It was perhaps inevitable. 

Know your audience: adult age males like R-rated superhero movies. Families and younger males like PG and PG-13 movies. 

Not every movie should be for the same target audience. 

The market for R-rated movies is real. But G, PG, and PG-13 movies still make the overwhelming majority of money (70% or so). (http://www.the-numbers.com/market/mpaa-ratings) 

A reasonable hope to preserve is that R-rated superhero movies will add to,  not eliminate, the market for PG-13 superhero movies.
