This is my first time watching a Comic Book Girl video, but everything she says about the new Ghostbusters seems reasonable to me. Also, [that hair.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQIuTGfPHvA)

Disclaimers: 

(a) I haven't seen the new one (but plan to). 

(b) I liked the originals but they are not in my top 10 or top 50. 

Was not enourmous fan of original Ghostbusters. I was a little young for it, never watched 'em more than twice. Ranks up there with, maybe Speed as a movie I enjoyed but did not see more than once or twice. So I don't have a lot invested in a remake. 

To me the trailer for the new one looked... meh. The bruhaha over the movie interests me though. 


UPDATE: 

I'm watching, and very much enjoying, Ghostbusters (1984). After that, the sequel!
