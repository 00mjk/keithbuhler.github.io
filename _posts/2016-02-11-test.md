# Philosophy is science #

Collectively waking out of our scientistic stupor by realizing that science and philosophy are identical, or continuous, or unified. 




## About the argument ##

### What is the thesis? 
Our view is that
* knowledge is the unitary goal of theoretical scientific and philosophical inquiry;
* all methods that produce knowledge are genuinely scientific methods and philosophical methods; 
* the distinctions between sciences (such as metaphysics and physics) are not distinctions science and non-science but between distinct subject matters, methods of inquiry, and professional associations;
* the only justifiable distinction between science and non-science is identical to the distinction between true and false;
* truth is correspondence with reality;
* knowledge is true belief about reality;
* All real entities are real, whether concrete, abstract, physical, immaterial, or what have you -- an object need not be material to be real.

Our view may be characterized in the following ways:
* scientific realism 
* metaphysical realism (possibly with transcendental idealism, but not with anti-realism)
* epistemic externalism

### Why do you believe that thesis? ###

See the "Arguments -- philosophy is science" section.

### Are you serious?  ###
Yes. Words matter. Categorization matters. Our only concern is the truth. 

The best reasons seem to us to demand that modern science is a branch of classical philosophy, that modern philosophy is a branch of classical science, that what passes for "philosophy" in universities and "science" in labratories are two parts of one continuous whole: the pursuit of knowledge, the gathering of knowledge, the education of others in that knowledge. Restricting the term 'knowledge' to mean only one part of knowledge is a dangerous, antiscientific, miserable falsehood. 


### But people don't use words like that ###

If our argument is correct, then they should use words in ways that reflect the real, justifiable, distinctions. If our argument is incorrect, then they should go about using words the same way. Do you agree with the argument? 

### Does anyone agree with you? ###

Yes. Most philosophers in most places and most times did not confuse one part of philosophy (natural philosophy) with the whole of philosophy; most researchers in most places at most times did not confuse one part of science (natural science) with the whole of science. 


> "Feyerabend argued that [natural] science does not in fact occupy a special place in terms of either its logic or method, and no claim to special authority made by [natural] scientists can be upheld. He argued that, within the history of [natural] scientific practice, no rule or method can be found that has not been violated or circumvented at some point in order to advance [all] scientific knowledge. Both Lakatos and Feyerabend suggest that [natural] science is not an autonomous form of reasoning, but is inseparable from [science]."

### How do I join? ###
* Link to this site. 
* Challenge people to articulate the demarcation between science and non-science; when they give you some criterion (say, the distinction between physical and abstract), point out that this is a distinction between two kinds of science, or to distinct sciences. 
* If they argue that all non-science is false, point out that works of art can communicate truth. 


### What's new? ###
We're adding objections as they come in. 

We're also putting in more links and more arguments from authority. 

### Do you have swag?  ###
Not at this time. If you want some, let me know. 


### Sample dialogue ###

* 


### Why do you care?  ###

* It's fun to think. Thinking through this argument was fun. We want others to think it through, for fun. 
* The conclusion seems true. We want others to find out whether our conclusion is true. 
* If it is, and they know it, we will agree. If it is true, and others don't know it, we will disagree with them, but we will still be correct, and they incorrect.
* If it is not, then we hope their objections will cause us to think it through again. And if the objections change our mind, then then we will agree, and will take down this site.

### Don't you have nefarious motives? ###

Nope. We don't care about the consquences of the truth getting out, changes in funding, public opinion, etc. We just care about getting things straight.

## Objections -- philosophy is not science! ##

**Objection 1: Philosophy uses "rational tools of logical analysis and conceptual clarification" while science uses "empirical measurement" as Friedland argues.**

This objection assumes science is not philosophy and attempts to articulate the difference. But I have shown above that science and philosophy are coextensive. Mathematics is a rationalistic and not empirical science; applied mathematics is a rationalistic and empirical science. Metaphysics is a rationalistic and (usually) not empirical science; ethics is a rational and empirical science.

**Objection 2: Science is about nature, philosophy is about concepts. Science conducts experiments, philosophy only conducts thought experiments.**

This objection also mistakenly assumes science is not philosophy. 

Also, "Quark" and "Higgs-boson particle" are concepts in physical science that are being debated across schools of thought but are agreed upon within schools of thought. "Nature" and "being" are concepts in metaphysical science that are being debated across schools of thought but are agreed upon within schools of thought. 

Some physicists conduct thought experiments and some philosophers of mind conduct empirical experiments.

**Objection 3: Science progresses, philosophy doesn't progress but is circular or stagnant, or empty.**

This objection assumes (a) that all disciplines that progress are sciences and (b) disciplines that do not progress are not sciences, and (c) that all progress is good, and (d) it mistakenly assumes that science is not philosophy. Three responses are possible: 
 (a) Physics progresses (from Newton to Einstein), metaphysics progresses (from Anaxagoras to Aquinas).
(b) Also, physics, metaphysics, ethics, logic and other disciplines can and does sadly regress. That doesn't mean they are not longer sciences, it means they have lost some truths or acquired some falsehoods.
(c) Not all "progress" is good. Some progress is neutral. Progress of a civilization toward decadence is not good, because decadence is not good. Progress of a philosophy department toward racial uniformity is not good because diversity is good. Furthermore, the true "progress" is not of the human race from generation to generation but of each human person within each generation.
(d) I dealt with above.

**Objection 4: Science deals with the nature of the universe (a la Aristotle's Physics); philosophy deals with the nature of causation (a la Aristotle's Metaphysics), as Michael Ruse argues.**
This objection also mistakenly assumes science is not philosophy. Circular reasoning.
Physicists deal with causation and metaphysicians deal with the nature of the universe. We should not be surprised that Michael Ruse thinks this. His scientistic ideology is predicated on the belief that natural science can know everything that can be known, so there is no other form of science. But this is a philosophical belief and the proof of it is not empirical; so scientistic ideology is incoherent and self-defeating. Just because it masquerades as a justifiable and respectable scientific inference doesn't mean it's true. Just the opposite: it means scientism is pseudoscience. 

**Objection 5: Science is divided into physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, economics, and so on; philosophy is divided into metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of mind, and so on. These are clearly separate domains.**
This objection also mistakenly assumes science is not philosophy. Circular reasoning.
It is true that there are different disciplines, distinguished by their subject matter, methods, and professional/sociological groups.

**Objection 6: Science has nothing to do with religion or gods; philosophy overlaps with religious questions like the existence of God, the "true nature of reality", what existed before time and space and what will exist after the heat death of the universe.**

Even Dawkins agrees that the existence of God makes a scientific difference.

Also, the multiverse theory is scientific but concerns the "true nature of reality". 

This objection also mistakenly assumes science is not philosophy. Circular reasoning.

**Objection 7: Scientific methods involve testable, confirmable hypotheses; philosophical methods involve abstract, untestable, unconfirmable hypotheses.** 

The demarcation problem shows this definition to be false. Formal sciences like logic and math are not empirically testable and not meaningless. If logic, mathematics, statistics, theoretical computer science, information theory, game theory, systems theory, and decision theory don't have to, then neither do metaphysics, ethics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, etc. 

Furthermore, some hypotheses in philosophy of mind and ethics are empirically testable. 

**Objection 8: Professional scientists do not call themselves philosophers; professional philosophers do not call themselves scientists.**

True but not strictly speaking an objection. 

We who practice a discipline do not necessarily have time to re-think all the classificatory taxonomy by which our disciplines are related to each other and to all knowledge. We are too busy practicing our disciplines. But that doesn't mean that the "given" classificatory system is accurate. In fact, the taxonomy was so different 100, 200, or 300 years ago that one safe scientific/philosophical inference is that our current taxonomy will be radically different in 100 years.

**Objection 9: Science departments are not in the same building as university philosophy departments.**

This is true but not strictly speaking an objection. 

If my argument is correct, and the traditional classification of knowledge more accurate, then biologists and ethicists will again work in the same department. 

**Objection 10: Scientific hypotheses are either empirically testable or meaningless.**
The philosophical hypothesis stated in this objection is not empirically testable. Hence it must be meaningless.
Fallacy: appeal to personal incredulity? 

**Objection 11:J. L. Mackie argues that ethics and theology are both meaningless for the same reason: they are not empirical.**

* As many have rightly observed, Mackie's argument would exclude metaphysics, math, and logic from the honorific title 'science' as well. But, as I argued above, if math and logic are formal sciences then so are metaphysics and ethics; if math and logic are not sciences then biology and paleontology can't be scientific.

**Objection 12: But Wikipedia says science is different from philosophy.**

No, it doesn't. Philosophy is listed as a "formal" science.

Needless to say, Wikipedia can be wrong.

But also, even despite my tireless work to the contrary, Wikipedia displays a scientistic bias.

Finally, Wikipedia gets the history of natural science pretty much correct. The only thing it gets wrong is the article on so called "modern science" and "the" (one single, solitary) scientific method -- which it immediately admits is a body of methods.


**Objection 13: Science achieves consensus, or increasing convergence on truth; philosophy does not achieve such consensus.**

* Within a school of thought, practitioners of a specific discipline agree with each other; across schools of thought, practitioners of a specific discipline disagree with each other. This is just as true of physics as metaphysics, just as true of ethics as logic. There are more than 2,400 years of Aristotelian virtue ethicists who all have achieved consensus about the nature of the good and the importance of virtues and the definition of virtue.

**Objection 14: The argument that philosophy is a science is needless "science-envy" on the part of professional academic philosophers.**

Ad hominem, appeal to motive, Bulvernism.

I don't envy science. Unlike McGinn, I prefer the mellifluous and ancient word "philosopher" much better than the barbaric neologism "scientist." The former has a beautiful sound and meaning and is 2,400 words old and no worse for wear; the latter is 176 years old and no better than when it started.

Also, calling the speaker of an argument "envious" is an ad hominem and fallacy of relevance. The motive does not determine the truth or falsity but the content of the argument. 

**Objection 15: Science is descriptive and predictive; philosophy is (or can be) evaluative and prescriptive.** 
This is a true distinction between different kinds of sciences. But the objection mistakenly assumes that one or the other is not a science. 

**Objection 16:  There is some overlap between the two, as in the philosophy of science and a "scientific" study of philosophical problems. But neither is a subset of the other.**

This is an excellent objection. Identifying the overlap between (our current incoherent definitions of) science and philosophy helps us to see the conceptual "slippage" that results from thinking the issue through. Philosophy of science is part of every science, insofar as biologists and ethicists not only do their work but also reflect on what exactly their work is. 

**Objection 17: But you're crazy.**

Ad hominem. 
Circular reasoning.
True, but irrelevant.
