I've created a [repository](https://github.com/keithbuhler/Template-for-philosophy-dissertations) with my basic files to format academic papers, including dissertations. Mine is a philosophy dissertation, but this should work for any work in humanities.

Writing a dissertation is hard. Formatting all that content is hard in a totally different way. The goal of this template is to empower you to format your dissertation in a way that is beautiful, clean, and (relatively) easy by taking away some of the initial misteps and allowing you to troubleshoot your way forward.
