TLJ is a truly good film. 

As a basic necessity, it successfully looks, sounds, and "feels" like Star Wars. That doesn't make the movie great but it helps. 

Also, the acting is the best out of any Star Wars movie (except perhaps Rogue One). Leia's acting was better than passable, unlike The Force Awakens. Luke's acting is better than the Original Trilogy. Rey's acting has even come along, and Kylo Ren is even better than he was before (and still the best of the bunch). 

The acting and special effects and so on don't make a movie great, but I point them out because even the most aggrieved haters are admitting that they were good. Start with the obvious.

More to the point, *The Last Jedi* is actually a good film because it improves the Star Wars universe. 

Here's a few ways it does so.


## 1. Leia's Force Powers

It answered the question some of us have had for 30 years: if Leia is a Skywalker, why isn't she force sensitive? Or, if she is force sensitive, why doesn't she ever cultivate that ability? VII merely deferred this question by placing Leia firmly in her career as a military leader. VIII answers the question in a powerful and unexpected way: Leia has deep if undeveloped Force potential that she can use, at the verge of death, to pull herself to back toward her ship. She still nearly dies, but it saves her life. 

## 2. It explains the Force without ruining it

Another major question VIII answered is about the Force. What is the Force? Johnson managed to do something no on has yet done: explain the Force in more detail without making it hokey.

The Original Trilogy explain almost nothing besides Obi-wan's elliptical comments to Luke at the beginning of A New Hope. 

Episodes I-III did worse than silence: they partially [demythologized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demythologization) the force by explaining it away as a scientifically measurable particle in the blood (or at least appearing to do so). 

Episode VII, The Force Awakens made a few playful quips about "That's not how the force works!" but did not *explain* anything. If anything, VII confused us by making Rey's "raw, untamed" strength so useful despite no training or understanding.

According to Johnson's New and Improved concept of the Force, it is a balance between light and dark, life and death, that does not belong just to Jedi. 


- Luke Skywalker: Breathe. Just breathe. Now reach out. What do you see? 
- Rey: Light. Darkness. A balance. 
- Luke Skywalker: It's so much bigger.

... 

- Luke Skywalker: What do you see?
- Rey: The island. Life. Death and decay, that feeds new life. Warmth. Cold. Peace. Violence.
- Luke Skywalker: And between it all?
- Rey: Balance and energy. A force.
- Luke Skywalker: And inside you?
- Rey: Inside me, that same force.


I don't know exactly what all this means, but it actually sounds worth thinking through. There might be something to it. 

That's an achievement. 

## 3. The Plot is Perfect 

I know, there are big complaints with the plot. But hear me out. 

To paraphrase screenwriting guru Robert McKee, [plot is "value reversal".](https://www.slideshare.net/jucaitis/the-elements-of-story-by-robert-mckee) Plot is the change from a starting condition to the final condition. 

Plot can be either *what happens* or *what is revealed*; it can be what characters *do* and what they *discover*. 

A movie's plot has to show the movement or transformation from state A to  B: In a Rom Com, the plot is the transition from lonely and single to happily married; in a horror movie it's the transition from safe and alive to scarred and dead. In a Star Wars movie the "plot" is the balance between light and dark, not just whether or not the Death Star has been destroyed. 

TLJ begins with a space battle between the First Order (at the height of its powers) and the Resistance. It ends with the First Order basically victorious, taking some losses but almost snuffing out the Resistance entirely. All the remaining souls in the Resistance fit on the Millennium Falcon and zero of the resistance sympathizers who are  “scattered in the outer rim” responded to Leia’s distress signal.

It begins with Kylo Ren submissive to Snoke, the Supreme Leader, but failing to commit matricide against his own biological mother. It ends with Ren as the new Supreme Leader, having committed patricide against his own guru. 

It begins with Rey, handing Luke his old lightsaber, askin him to join the Resistance, and asking him to develop her  "raw, untamed power" to show her  "her place in all this." It ends with Luke having helped Rey train at least a little (2 out of 3 lessons isn't bad!) More importantly, Luke ultimately grants Leia's wish to help the Resistance. Despite being old and shipless, he uses his Legendary status as Luke Skywalker to knock Kylo Ren down a peg, and tell the new Supreme Leader that "the war is just beginning." We are also lead to wonder if Luke may return in Episode IX, as a Force Ghost, to finish Rey's lessons. 

All of this is perfectly good stuff. 

## Two Big Objections

![dreadnought](https://i0.wp.com/thekingdominsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/First-Order-Dreadnought-snoke-star-destroyer.jpg?resize=786%2C387)

Most of the complaints about the plot are complaints about (a) the "run and chase" Macguffin or (b) the Canto Bight sequence. 

First, *it is* lame that the First Order just puts it in autopilot and chases the Resistance Fleet. But it's not unacceptably lame. Because this movie is not about the First Order / Resistance chase scene. It's about Rey, Kylo, Snoke, Luke. It's about hope, failure, and balance. 

On these main themes, the movie is tightly constructed: Snoke is dead, but so is Luke. Ren is the Supreme Leader, but Rey is going to be a Jedi. 

The Resistance is hurt badly, but there may already be allies born (the slave children on Canto Bight) who will soon be old enough to fight, especially if they are inspired by harrowing tales of of the heroism of Luke Skywalker. 

Secondly, the Canto Bight sequence is not pointless. It shows us a third segment of the Star Wars galaxy: the polished, clean, rich kind of villainy. We've seen the Emperor's sinister darkness, the Ewok's natural goodness, Jabba's dirty ignobility. We've now seen a slick form of evil, the degeneracy of the casino and the [nearly lethal comforts of the luxory cruise.](https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf) Canto Bight is everything wrong with Monte Carlo, Vegas, Cruise Ships, the Derby. Even if you disagree that being rich makes you evil, there are special evils particular to the rich.

Canto Bight also introduces us to the child with the broom who is likely to be the hero of a new Star Wars movie, or potentially [even a new trilogy.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-last-jedi-rian-johnson-new-trilogy-1068535) This child also confirms that the shocking revelation about Rey's parents is true, and not just a lie from Kylo. Rey is a "nobody" from "nowhere" and yet she is a rockstar with the Force. That child with the broom proves, as Ratatouille does, that not everyone can be a great Jedi but a great Jedi can come from anywhere.

## In conclusion

Episode VIII has flaws. And I understand if you hate it. 

But for these reasons, among others, I think it's Rian Johnson's best by far followed by Looper and Brother's Bloom. 

My sense is that it is *probably* better than Rogue One or Episode VII, but I'm open to negotiating that.
