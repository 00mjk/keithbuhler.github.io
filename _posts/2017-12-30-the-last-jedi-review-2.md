## A Paradoxical Big Picture

Was TLJ a good movie? Did it satisfy expectations? Did it please fans and critics? 

First, we have to keep some perspective. 

TLJ had to meet *insane and impossible expectations*: it had to be on brand for a Star Wars movie and yet unpredictable, unexpected, and surprising. 

It had to avoid the pitfalls of the Lucas-era prequels (too different from the original trilogy) and that of the JJ Abrams reboot (too similar to the original trilogy).

It had to please original trilogy fans (age 20-45) who  have enchanted childhood memories of Perfect Star Wars films and it had to please "new" young fans (age 5-12) for whom this may be their first Star Wars films. 

The only way to meet paradoxical demands is with a paradoxical solution.

In my view, TLJ met all the impossible expectations by being impossibly good. It did contradictory things at the same time and somehow worked.




## Setting Expectations

TLJ was comfortably familiar: the opening space battle against impossible odds, the "run and chase" plot that doesn't really matter (remember the "run from the Empire" plot of *Empire Strikes Back*?), an awesome light-saber battle, the unbreakable bond between Luke and Leia, the "Resistance" forces are back to being called "Rebels", AT-AT Walkers, an ice planet -- scratch that, salt planet.  The best moment of the film -- Luke gazing into the sunset on Ahch Tu -- was powerful in its own right and recalled the best moment in the Star Wars Saga -- Luke gazing into the twin sunset on Tatooine. 

Also, TLJ was uncomfortably new: the irreverent humor, the Rose sub-plot, the alien milking, Luke's cynicism, Leia's surprising display of the Force, the visit to Canto Bight, the not so subtle "social justice" points about animal rights and war profiteering, Snoke's untimely demise, Rey's Jedi training (or lack thereof), the "Master Codebreaker" con man character, Luke's force projection. And more. 

Ask yourself, though: How much of your love or hatred of the movie arises from the new, different, and weird stuff?

Then ask yourself: what else could Johnson do? 

[Episode VII was some new, mostly old.](http://www.keithbuhler.com/viicopyiv) That's because J.J. Abrams is a re-make artist: Mission Impossible, Star Trek, Star Wars, Super 8 (basically a nostalgic remake of Goonies and other Spielburg films), and finally Episode VII. 

By contrast, Rian Johnson is an original artist. Johnson made his name writing and directing movies from all the most brain-bending genres, such as a time-travel film ([Looper](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1276104/)), a noir whodunnit ([Brick](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393109/)), and a film about two professional con men [(Brothers Bloom).](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844286/) 

Accordingly, TLJ had enough twists and turns to keep audiences guessing the entire film, complete with a surprise ending.

If the film didn't ask audiences to expand and stretch their definition of Star Wars, we would have complained that it was "too similar." 

TLJ was undeniably "weird". It was weird in ways that are idiosyncratic to Johnson alone. I would guess that's why Kathleen Kennedy chose him to direct. She was right to do so. 

Star Wars was either going to turn down the safe "remake Empire Strikes Back" or make a sharp left turn and become... weirder. Bodhisattva Luke weird. Super Leia space flight weird. Monte Carlo horse racing weird. Purple-hair Holdo weird. 


What else could Johnson do? 

If the answer is "Nothing", then a lot of complaints become moot. Yes, it was weird. But if the only other option was to have JJ Abrams remake Episode V with slight variations, then a whole other set of fans would have complained, and rightly so, for that very reason. 


Again, was TLJ a good movie? Did it satisfy expectations? Did it please fans and critics? It was a good movie by simultaneously satisfying *some* expectations and defying others. 

The only expectation you needed to enjoy this film was to expect the unexpected. Expect a movie about con-men, time travel, and whodunnit mysteries, because that's what Johnson is good at. 

If that was your expectation, that's exactly what you got. 

If you want to enjoy this movie, it's up to you. Don't complain that it was too different from the original trilogy or Episode VII. Be grateful it wasn't too similar. "This is how we win: not by fighting what we hate, but by saving what we love." That line, from Rose, was the second most important line of the film. 

The first most important is coming soon...
