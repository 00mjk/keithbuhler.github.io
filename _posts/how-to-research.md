Your goal in conducting research is simple: to *learn something new.* Only then can you present your findings to the world in a useful and engaging manner.

The ultimate reason for scholarly research is to expand the pool of human knowledge. But the first step is less grand --- it is simply the effort to increase *your own* new knowledge. Once  you fill up your own "bucket" you can pour it into the larger "pool" of human knowledge. 

New knowledge comes from good research. Professional researchers from every time and place in history until today have followed certain tried and true research methodologies in finding out answers to their questions and presenting those answers to others. 

In this article we will discuss the 3 fundamental steps to good research:


I. Asking a clear question;

II. Thoroughly answering your question, and;

III. Organizing your answer(s) for presentation.

Let's take a look at each step in more detail.

First **determine your field.** There are many scholarly disciplines. Perhaps the most useful broad categorization is between Humanities, Sciences, and Social Sciences.

● **Humanities:** Humanities like philosophy, literature, and history study the books, events, artistic creations, and thoughts of human beings "from within", using experience and logic to understand what is distinctly human, as weird and wonderful as we are.

● **Science:** Sciences like physics, chemistry, and biology study everything else besides the inner life of people, using experiment to understand all the natural objects that surround or interest us in the cosmos.

● **Social Science:** Social sciences like psychology, sociology, and economics study human societies and individuals "from without," treating humans as objects of the natural world.

Each field has a distinct emphasis in its research methodology. Humanities emphasizes qualitative techniques while science emphasizes the quantitative. Social science uses a blend of both, emphasizing one or the other depending on the particular field or research question.

In order to conduct good research, **you need a clear question.** This is the source and spine of your research, for it determines what answers you are looking for and how you will organize them.  

You need to find **one or more clear answers to that question**. Finding the answer is the hard work of uncovering new, salient information on your topic from people or from written sources.

# I. Asking a clear question

Ask yourself, "What mystery do I aim to resolve?" It may take multiple revisions before nailing down exactly the scope and goal of your research project.

The 3 steps to asking a great question are:

1. Make it clear.
2. Make it the right *type of* question.
3. Decide on a provisional question *before* you start thoroughly researching.

## I.1 Make it clear

Your question should be very simple and clear.

* A paragraph long description of what you hope to discover is too long and will make research overwhelming and results vague.
* What problem are you fascinated by? If it reflects your own real, natural curiosity, then it will probably interest others as well. Seminal works in all disciplines have simple goals to answer a clear question:  Plato's *Republic* is a long and complicated discussion with a very simple premise: "Is it better to be just or unjust?"  Darwin's *Origin of Species* asks a simple question with enormous ramifications: "Do many species today originate from *many* species or *one original* species?"  Freud's *Civilization and Its Discontents* asks a basic question with fascinating results, "Why are people unhappy?" 

## I.2 Make it the right *type* of question

Think carefully about what type of question you are aiming to answer.

* Some questions aim at determining relationships, e.g., "Does eating sugar cause cancer? or "What is the relationship between justice and happiness?"
* Some questions are simply descriptive, e.g., "What are the surface characteristics of the dark side of the moon?" or "What is the original species?"
*  Some questions aim at identifying a difference or contrast, e.g., "What is the effect of internal corruption on the fall of Roman Caesar as compared to the fall of the Russian Czar?" or "Why are some people happier than others?"

## I.3. Decide on a provisional question *before* you start thoroughly researching.

Now, decide your initial question. But it's important to have at least a provisional research question written down before you begin research.

* Be decisive! Your question won't be perfect the first time, but it must be done. It may need to be revised many times before you settle on a clear, simple, precise, and answerable question.
* After stating your provisional question, conduct a short review of literature. This will help you to distill your thoughts, further clarify your question, and avoid repetition or overlap with other researchers.

## II. Thoroughly answering your question

Now that your question is stated, the hard work begins. You must go about uncovering a whole swath of relevant information, research, and experience to give you the evidence needed to treat your question adequately.

The three steps to thoroughly answering your question are:

1. Develop a hypothesis.
2. Choose the appropriate sources and methods.
3. Read the scholarly literature.


### Develop a hypothesis

A clear question has a few possible clear answers. What are yours? Brainstorm a 3 or 4 possible answers to your question. For "Why are people discontent?" we might brainstorm "poverty, sickness, sin, ignorance, or death."

* Pick your initial guess. As strange as it may seem, many great scientific and philosophical discoveries begin as a hunch, an instinct, a guess.
* Of course, your guess may be wrong. Regardless of whether it turns out to be right or wrong, this initial guess (or hypothesis) will be indispensable in guiding your research.
* Your job is to "guess" what the answer *might* be, and then find out what it really is.

### Choose the appropriate sources and methods.

Each discipline has its own typical sources and methods.

* For scientific disciplines, primary research may include designing and conducting original experiments.
* For social sciences, it may include gathering data through surveys or other systematic types of observation. For humanities, it may include positing new theories or generating new questions.


There are several sources of information from which to generate your hypothesis:

* Experience of the world. Observing the behavior of animals, chemicals, or material objects in a controlled or uncontrolled environment and analyzing the mathematical properties and relationships of spatial and temporal objects.
* People. Personal conversation, talking to authorities on the subject, gathering custom and tradition.

Determine your basic research approach:

* Identify your target population and sample, or your target texts and papers.
* What is your plan for data collection? Software programs like Microsoft Excel and Access are useful tools for collecting and organizing quantitative data. Simple word-processing programs or a pen and paper are useful tools for collecting thoughts, ideas, stories, and reminders.
* Select the instruments and procedures you plan to use.
* Most graduate students and many professionals conduct the bulk of their research through engaging with secondary sources.
* Reviewing the literature in your field is essential for ensuring that your answer is original.
* It also helps clarify your question as you refine it again and again.

### Read the scholarly literature

The most powerful tool for research is the existing literature on your subject. Books, articles, journals, online resources (blogs, encyclopedias, indices) contain a solid geography of human knowledge, waiting to be explored, mined, and put to good use.

These are "secondary sources" since they are the finished research of other scholars. Your research, when presented, will add to this body of literature.

Pick a few journals within which to begin searching. At your library or personal computer check out online databases such as:

* [Jstor](http://www.jstor.org/) (Journal Storage)
* [Ebsco](http://www.ebscohost.com/)
* [Questia](http://www.questia.com/)
* [Science Citation Index](http://ip-science.thomsonreuters.com/cgi-bin/jrnlst/jloptions.cgi?PC=K)
* [Social Science Index](http://thomsonreuters.com/social-sciences-citation-index/)
* [Philosopher's Index](http://philindex.org/)

Also check out relevant trade publications, newspapers, magazines, annual reports,  company literature, and any other salient published materials.


Don't get overwhelmed. Follow the steps to keep your research within manageable limits: 

* Conduct initial keyword searches on your topic or question.
* Skim the search results for relevant titles, abstracts, important authors, and other salient features.
* Download a small set of 10-20 articles whose title or abstract seems especially relevant to answering your question.
* Skim or speed read these articles and make a note of those that merit further study.
* Read, take notes on, and copy important information from, these articles.
* Keep track of [citation information](http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workshop/citation.htm) (author, title, publication, year, etc.)  for each article you read.

Repeat this process each time that you reformulate your question and/or your working hypothesis. You will see your knowledge grow and your results sharpen into focus!

### Talk to people

Sometimes, changing the world and advancing human knowledge is as simple as having a conversation. 

In diverse contexts such as film documentaries, high profile public trials of Senators, college classrooms, and personal relationships, the biggest turning points consist of two or more people sharing thoughts and feelings in conversation.

There are a few ways to gather information directly from people that might work for your project. Each has its benefits and costs.

#### In Person

* Organize a focus group for preliminary research and to explore people's unfiltered emotions and thoughts. Although the sample size is small, the results are very clear and can help define hypotheses or further research directions.
* Conduct a series of personal interviews. Although potentially expensive, these are in-depth and informal. Even the same strict series of questions may unfold differently with each interviewed person. The results are the most difficult to quantify (and are often presented as-is) but the most qualitatively rich.

#### [Surveys](http://www.statpac.com/)

* Design and conduct a telephone surveys. Telephone surveys are fast and relatively inexpensive. Results are easily quantifiable but still allow room for the interviewed person to go "off script" to give unanticipated qualitative answers. 
* Design and conduct a mail survey. Mail surveys are useful for larger sample sizes aimed at capturing a variety of demographics. They cost less but take longer than phone interviews, and have the least qualitative richness.
* Design and conduct an email or internet survey. Many new online tools allow you to easily create and distribute online surveys. Sometimes a survey will even "go viral" dramatically increasing your sample size and improving your results. Many are free or very cost effective, although the population of those with regular access to personal computers excludes certain demographics.

## III. Organizing your answer(s) for presentation.

A whole host of information gathered is of no use to your readers or listeners if it is not organized in an accessible way. All your research must hang on your structure like flesh and blood on a skeleton. And the skeleton must be decided beforehand.

After you have spent many hours reading, researching, gathering data, conducting surveys, experiments, and thinking, you are ready to begin synthesizing your data into a clear answer to your initial question.

The three steps to organizing your answer are:

1. Structure and interpret your results.
2. State your conclusion.
3. Double check your work.


<br>

### Structure and interpret your results

* One of the most powerful structures is the "[Instant Thesis](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Panic-Procrastinators-Writing-Effective/dp/0942208420)" popularized by Steven Posusta. The sentence takes the form, "Although... Nevertheless, I argue... Because..."

* This thesis is really a clear three part structure for organizing arguments and evidence. The first part "Although" is the objections or counter arguments to your thesis that might exist. The second part "Nevertheless" is the core of what you are positing as true, your bucket of new knowledge. The third part "Because" is the evidence, examples, statistics, and arguments that support your "Nevertheless, I argue."
* You are now in the position to take a step back from your research and plug it in to the above structure of arguments, counter arguments, and evidence.
* Try putting it together in a first draft. It does not have to be perfect the first time.

### Form your conclusions.

Does the evidence support or refute the original hypothesis or refute it?

* You may feel that your research has been inadequate to comprehensively and finally answer your question. In one sense, that is always true. Be realistic. Your goal as a developing scholar is to advance knowledge one small step.
* Formulate your terms to be clear and your conclusions to be succinct.

### Double check your work.

Every scholar makes mistakes or overlooks something. But good scholars catch their own mistakes before publication. Double checking your work ensures

* that your sources are credible and relevant
* your sources are cited correctly and fully
* your work is ethical
* your conclusions are valid and accurate

Writing a publication quality scholarly article takes time, practice, patience, endurance, and dedication to providing excellent answers to important questions. Consider how-to guide like [**Writing your Journal Article in 12 Weeks**](http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/141295701X), by Wendy Belcher.

Now you are ready to present your research. Whether you turn in the work to a professor or publish it in a journal, you have hunted and captured new knowledge, and brought that knowledge to others.
