# Everything Else #


**Flesh knows; but spirit knows it knows**
-Charles Williams

## Biography

Rich and Linda Buhler begat seven kids, of which I am the youngest.  I was born around Christmas in Los Alamitos, California.   I grew up in LA and Orange County, which is why I am so uncultured. I was homeschooled, which is why I am so pale. 

I attended Biola University in 2000 and Talbot Graduate School in 2007, The Antiochian House of Studies in 2009, so I've studied history, philosophy, and theology thus far. We moved to Kentucky in 2012.This is my first time living out of the country. 

I married Lindsay in 2010 and we had our first child in 2012, just a week before classes started. The rest has not been quite so crazy. We currently live in Wilmore with our second child on the way.
