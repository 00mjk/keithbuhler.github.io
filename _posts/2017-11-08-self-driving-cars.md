[A self-driving van crashed on its first day at work.](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/self-driving-bus-car-las-vegas-crash-navya-a8045026.html)

I'm not worried about crashes. Turns out a truck crashed *into* this self-driving bus, anyway. 

The technology will never make perfect driving cars but we are probably already close to or beyond "better-than-human" driving cars. So I'm not worried about the relatively fewer accidents.


I'm worried about the loss of millions of good jobs. My worry is about the loss of dignity for millions of people who are doing good human work, for pay, who will have to take worse jobs or live off welfare (i.e., be paid for not working).

Yes, many those jobs will be replaced by new, unrelated jobs in other fields or related fields. But the question remains: what about when artificially intelligent machines can do *those* new jobs too? 

Technology should not just be efficient. 

The only ethical way to use technology is to make sure it serves human ends. It must serve us, not demand our service.

At the same time, creation and innovation is also human. So the question is: how do we obey the imperative to continue to create and innovate while also obeying the imperative to prevent the destruction of real human goods -- to prevent our tools from using us?

The solution to the paradox is simple, but requires will: the solution is *to continue to make technology but not use it.* 

Build toys, play with them, and put them away. At least, don't mass produce them. Teach others to make their own. Let *them* innovate and create too. Don't let a few creators like Google and Wikipedia turn the rest of us into enervated consumers who don't even know how to use Google or Wikipedia. 

In the case of cars, if self-driving cars are perfected, they should remain hobbies for those wealthy or bored enough to play with them; they should not become not giant corporate fleets that replace entire professions.

If that solution sounds impossible to you, then think about gardening or exercising. Why garden? Why work out? We continue to garden and exercise because it is intrinsically good and human to do so, not because machines can't do it better. Machines can, in theory, be designed to do everything better -- including wipe your own nose, call your mom on her birthday, and write your school essays. Will you let them? Or will you continue to do what is intrinsically good to do? 

Technology is a tool. If we let it become our master, it will consume us. We drive a stake through its heart by simply continuing to do for ourselves what is worth doing. 

Required reading for those designing self-driving cars and folks (like Uber and Tesla) who are building companies to use them: Wendell Barry, *What Are People For?*; C. S. Lewis, *Abolition of Man*, chapter 3; Anthony Eselon, *10 Ways to Destroy the Imagination of your Child*, chapter 2.
