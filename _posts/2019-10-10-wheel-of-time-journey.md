I just yesterday finished the Wheel of Time. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time]

It's longest continuous narrative about a single hero ever written by a human being. 

It's 11,308 pages. That's about 11 Lord of the Rings (1,000 pages) almost 4 Bibles (3,000 pages) and almost 3 Harry Potters (all seven books combined are about 4,200 pages). 

Robert Jordan (and, after his death, Brandon Sanderson) wrote 4 million words about how Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, and his friends save the world. 

I enjoyed the series, with some serious caveats. But this post is not about my review of the content. It's about the sheer magnitude of the project of writing (and reading!) this beast of a series. 

A whole bunch of statistics can be run on this series. For example, from Reddit: "There are 4.41 million words in WoT. The average adult reading rate is 250 words per minute. Thus, the average adult would require 17640 minutes (294 hours) to read it all." That's only 48 minutes a day, without fail, for a whole year. 

Here's my statistics. Which books I read whe. 

1994: Read Book 1, 2, 3. (age 12)  
1995: Read Book 4, 5, 6.   
1996: Re-read Books 1-6, read Book 7.

2013. Re-read Book 7. Read Book 8. 
2014. Read Book 9. 
2015. N/A
2016. N/A
2017. N/A (finished grad school)
2018. Read Book 10, 11, 12, 13. 
2019. Read Book 14.  (age 36)

You can see quite the hiatus between before high school and after graduate school. In 2013 I resolved to read more fiction as a counterpoint to all the academic reading; and in 2018 I resolved to finish the series even if it killed me. 

In a real way, I grew up with Robert Jordan and his characters. 

The only thing I will say by way of review is this: 

Sanderson's writing is so far superior to Jordan's that the ending was satisfying, after all those years. 

And that we should be excited for [Amazon's adaptation.](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20805951/wheel-of-time-amazon-show-prime-video-adaptation-cast-rand-althor-robert-jordan-actors)

What fantasy or sci-fi series should I read next?
