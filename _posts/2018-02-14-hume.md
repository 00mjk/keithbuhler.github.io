Here's a brief article idea. What do you make of it? 

Who else has made the same argument? 

--- 

In his *Treatise on Human Nature*, Hume argues for a skeptical approach to concepts such as necessity, miracles, and freedom of the will.  

In his project, Hume bases a whole epistemological theory on the following proposition: 

>P1: "All objects of human reason or inquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas and Matters of Fact." 

P1 paraphrased: Human reason can only know two kinds of truths, necessary truths and contingent truths. 

From this premise, Hume points out that certain ideas (such as causation) seem to be necessary truths but in fact are neither relations of ideas nor really matters of fact, because the problem of induction prevents us from jumping to the conclusion that many contingent relations can add up to a necessary relation. 

The question is this: Is P1 itself a matter of fact or relation of ideas? 

Answer: it's neither. 

The same paradox arises if I said "All possible sentences are either written in Chinese or Spanish." That sentence itself is written in neither -- it's in English. It's self-refuting. 



If P1 is neither a matter of fact (contingent truth) nor relation of idea (necessary truth), then even if it is true, it is ipso facto self-refuting. It is like a liar's paradox where it is only true if it's false and only false if it's true. 

If P1 is neither a matter of fact (contingent truth) nor relation of idea (necessary truth), then it is false. 

So P1 is either true or false. If it is true then it is self-refuting and therefore false. If it is false, it is just false. In other words, P1 is either self-refuting or false.  

Either way, P1 is false.

So all else that Hume builds on that proposition are either false or must be argued for from a different premise.

Clearly this way of laying out the argument is elliptical. A lot more needs to be said about Hume's exact division between contingent and necessary truths (which is more than a single premise) and how that distinction fits into his project. And a lot needs to be said for Kant's appropriation of Hume's skepticism. But even in it's compacted form, what do you make of the argument?
