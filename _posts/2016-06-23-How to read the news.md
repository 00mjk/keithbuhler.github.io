# How to read the news

Are you getting just one side of the story? 

If you only read the news on Facebook, Twitter, [the answer is certainly yes.](https://www.rt.com/news/328177-facebook-narrow-minded-study/)

Even if you get your news anywhere online, you might be doing it wrong. It's not that every news media source is "biased" in some vicious way. It's just that everyone has an angle. But with a critical eye, you can read the news well and get both sides of every story.  

The veneer of objectivity may have sold well in newspapers and early in the Television Age. It doesn't sell well in the Internet Age. The reason is that there are two kinds of bias. One is intentional, wilful, and intellectually dishonest. This is the kind of bias you see produced by explicit propaganda machines. 

The other kind of "bias" is unintentional, accidental, and intellectual honest. You can quibble with my calling it "bias" -- it is a certain kind of spin that can't be avoided. 

In this post, I explain 3 kinds of bias you can't avoid, and 2 strategies for overcoming them by regularly reading 4 news categories. 


## 3 kinds of bias you can't avoid

No matter how you present a story, there are three choices you have to make: you have to express the story in certain words and not others; you have to frame the story with a beginning and end; and you have to select *which* story to tell in the first place. 

These are the three kinds of bias you can't avoid. 

1. [Selection bias](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Selection_bias) -- This is a kind of ommission. Why did you pick this story? You can only tell one story at a time, so why this one? Why pick out a story about police brutality, a story about Hilary's lies, a story about endangered animals being killed? 
2. [Framing bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)) -- This is, again, a necessity when telling a story. A story, like a picture, needs a frame. It's just part of what it means to be a story. Nevertheless, this is a choice being made by the journalist or news media outlet. Is this a story 
3. "Spin" (expression bias?) -- using certain words to suggest a particular claim on reality without making the claim explicitly. 


## 2 strategies for overcome bias

1. Compare equal and opposite biases.  

Red and white together, not pink.  Twitter, Facebook are echo chambers! You can't get the other side there. "[A clear thinker] has kept [contradictions] side by side like two strong colours, red and white, like the red and white upon the shield of St. George. It has always had a healthy hatred of pink. It hates that combination of two colours which is the feeble expedient of the philosophers."([Chesterton, Orthodoxy](http://www.leaderu.com/cyber/books/orthodoxy/ch6.html))
2. Reflect on your own selection, framing, and spin. What is noteworthy to you? What would you have put in, left out? What do you really want to know? 


2. Read all 4 categories. 

Some news outlets are right-wing, others left-wing. Some are popular or lowbrow, others are more intellectual or high brow. See here for a graph [graph](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-your-preferred-news-outlet-says-about-your-political-ideology-2014-10)

So, read all four.

1. Popular, right wing (Drudge, Breitbart, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, The Blaze)
2. Popular, left wing (Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, Politico, Salon, NPR, Slate)
3. High brow, right wing (National Review, The Federalist, The American Conservative, First Things)
4. High brow, left wing (New York Times, New Yorker, Atlantic)

You could also read the centrist sources: Google News, Yahoo News. Sure, Fox is a mainstream rightist source, but you'll get everything right-leaning from categories 1 and 3. And sure, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS are mainstream leftist sources, but you'll get everything left leaning from categories 2 and 4.
