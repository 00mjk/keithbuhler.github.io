## Introduction

I don't envy [Chris Terrio.](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006516/) 

What in the world is Episode IX going to be about? 

Chris Terrio and JJ Abrams have to write a chapter to follow the Last Jedi (TLJ). Doing so is going to be almost impossible. I'll try to explain why later... But just think about it: What is it going to be about? 

Here's my bottom line review of The Last Jedi: the Rian Johnson hit his target in the bullseye. 

That is, he accomplished exactly what he set out to do; he satisfied his own criterion. 

The question (for audiences and critics) is whether he was aiming at the right target. If you agree with his target, you'll love the movie; if not, you'll hate it. I've not read or heard many  reviews that were lukewarm. Either Johnson improved Star Wars or "ruined" Star Wars. 

## Goals

In my review, I have three goals.

First, I want to argue that TLJ is a truly great film. 

Second, I want to argue that people are justified in not liking it.

In other words, I want to explain why this movie is so divisive and help each side understand the other. 

Almost half the movie going audience hated the dang thing; and almost half loved it.  The film is slightly less divisive than Donald Trump, but only slightly.

## Criteria?

![Poe, Rey, Finn](https://i0.wp.com/media2.slashfilm.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/star-wars-the-last-jedi-poe-rey-and-finn1.jpg)


To call any movie great, you have to defend a criterion of "greatness".

My two criteria are first, that *The Last Jedi* is a fun, entertaining movie that managed to defy my expectations and give me multiple big surprises, even after two years of fan speculation about Leia's fate, Rey's origin.  

Secondly, it improves the Star Wars canon. But what makes a Star Wars movie "Star Wars"? What is the essence of Star Wars? What does "being Star Wars-y" mean? That's a much harder question I'll try to tackle.) 

I won't fault anyone for disliking or even hating the movie. I've tried to read and hear as many negative reviews as possible to try and understand the fan experience of this film. In important ways, TLJ does violence to many aspects of "Star Wars." So I'll try to discuss the most common complaints below. 

Personally, I enjoyed every minute of it. This is a movie I will re-watch with pleasure, not out of hankering for the Original Trilogy (I can always watch the Original Trilogy for that!) but in order to again feel the awe and amazement at these characters and the power of the Force.

That said, there's no accounting for taste. I won't try to convince you that you "should" like the movie, or that it's wrong to be disappointed. 

Instead, I'll try to convince you that there is a mindset or set of expectations in which you can enjoy the movie, and a mindset or set of expectations in which you just cannot. 


## Conclusion

So, in sum, I want to defend the film by defining the criterion of success and explaining what 'mindset' makes it enjoyable, and then consider the biggest the complaints and objections and the 'mindset' that makes the film miserable. 

Why care this much about a movie? Because I think it represents a deeper challenge to our approach to change, to succession, to an artistic legacy like that of Lucas. Also because I want more people to enjoy this film as much as I did. (I know that desire is hopeless.)

So here goes.
