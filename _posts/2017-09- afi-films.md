In 2003, living with Biola University film students, I learned of the American Film Institute (AFI) list of top 100 American films.  I resolved to watch them all. Not only for self-education about film (who doesn't want to know more about film?) but for entertainment. 

The last 14 years have been a winding, wandering journey as far as media consumption. I've seen lots of recent movies in theater or on video, and read a lot more books than seen movies. 

Nevertheless, I've kept to the tortoise approach and kept watching AFI films. I've averaged one AFI film every two months for the past 14 years. 

(By contrast, I average 40 books a year.)

Each film is unique, interesting, surprising, fascinating, and delightful. 

Many of them were, for a time, "the best film I've ever seen"... until I watch the next one. 

I started at the top, going from the 1st best movie down the line. Until I realized that it would be more sumptious to move from 100th movie up. *Yankee Doodle Dandee* (#100) is still one of the best movies I've ever seen.

Now, the end is in sight. I'm on the final stretch. 

There are only 2 or 3 films on the list I've elected never to watch because recommendations have convinced me that the content is slimy and repulsive enough to be a waste of time. 

Of those I will see, the remaining films are: 

| Rank |    Title |
|------|----------|
|4    |Gone with the Wind (1939)|
|18   |Psycho (1960)|
|19   |Chinatown (1974)|
|21   |The Grapes of Wrath (1940)|
|24   |Raging Bull (1980)|
|42   |Rear Window (1954)|
|43   |King Kong (1933)|
|44   |The Birth of a Nation (1915)|
|45   |A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)|
|47   |Taxi Driver (1976)|
|72   |Ben-Hur (1959)|



Watching one a week I can finish by Christmas. One a month, I can finish by the end of next summer. I'm in no rush. But I'll keep you posted!

Finding the films is often tricky. Some you can rent or find free on YouTube. Some (like Birth of a Nation) are virtually unavailable. Others are only available at indy video shops or by electronic purchase. Others you have to chance upon a friend who owns them and will let you borrow them. I think I'll be able to track them down.
