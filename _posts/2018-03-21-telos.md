>The Greek word ‘telos’ is commonly translated as “end,” but it is bursting with an array of possible meanings, including: “definite point,” “goal,” “purpose,” “cessation,” “order,” “prize,” “highest point,” “realization,” “decision,” and “services.” See Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, (Harper & Brothers, 1896). 

>Strong fills out this already rich picture with a wider array of related meanings from the Koine Greek: “from a primary  (to set out for a definite point or goal); properly, the point aimed at as a limit, i.e. (by implication) the conclusion of an act or state (termination (literally, figuratively or indefinitely), result (immediate, ultimate or prophetic), purpose); specially, an impost or levy (as paid); continual, custom, end(-ing), finally, uttermost.” See Updated ed. La Habra: Lockman Foundation, 1995. Entry 5056.
