>Life is suffering.
>Love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated.
>Truth is the handmaiden of love. 
>Dialogue is the pathway to truth. 
>Humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn. 
>To learn is to die voluntarily and be born again, in great ways and small. 
>Speech must be untrammelled so that dialogue can take place; so that we can all humbly learn, so that truth can serve love, so that suffering can be ameliorated, so that we can all stumble forward to the kingdom of God.
