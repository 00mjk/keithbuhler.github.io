Eryxias by Plato (or pseudo-Plato) is a fascinating dialogue, regardless of authorship. 

It's points are these: 

1. Wisdom is wealth, because it is useful and can be traded for food and bodily needs.
2. Gold, silver, money, horses, etc. -- things considered wealth -- are useless without wisdom, because they might be just as likeley applied poorly as well. 
3. Money is wealth because it can be traded.
4. Anything useless cannot be wealth. 
5. Useful things can still *fail* to be wealth.
6. Conferring knowledge on someone who has money (horses, etc.) confers wealth upon them, transforming the useless things into useful.
