# Faith based film?

Randall Wallace is writing a sequel to The Passion.
In an earlier article, Mark Joseph explains why "faith-based" film is not a thing.

# Moving ad from Sanders

Great story of a guy who turned his life around.
I would challenge the notion of "education" though. To paraphrase a thought from Wendell Berry, there is an absurdity lurking here. It's not clear, for example, why lack of education is increasingly blamed for crime in the same society that increasingly looks upon truth as subjective and the classical tradition of western civilization as morally bankrupt.
Better yet: "“It is typical of our time,” Chesterton wrote, “that the more doubtful we are about the value of philosophy, the more certain we are about the value of education. That is to say, the more doubtful we are about whether we have any truth, the more certain we are (apparently) that we can teach it to children. The smaller our faith in doctrine, the larger our faith in doctors …”
Nevertheless, it's a moving ad.

# Dissertation writing bootcamp

UK Dissertation Writing Boot Camp Update:
Monday the 16th, my university began hosting a "Boot Camp" writing retreat. We have a private dorm room on campus, unlimited snacks (both healthy and unhealthy snacks, woo hoo!), an endless supply of coffee and soda, and the comforting presence of a community of 40 or so fellow writers.
The Boot Camp is two weeks long. We each commit to write at least 4 hours a day, Monday through Friday, for those two weeks. It's a time to write, revise, struggle, get confused, commiserate, write more, take breaks, and break through.
It's been awesome. Though tomorrow is the last day. Sad!
Here's what I've gotten done:
My process is rather messy. Each chapter goes through a stage: (1) draft, (2) revised draft, (3) polished draft, (4) submitted to advisor and approved or revised again.
Chapters 1 and 2 were already at stage (4), approved by advisor.
Chapter 3 was revised and is now polished.
Chapter 4 was drafted and is now revised.
Chapter 5 was drafted and is now revised.
Chapter 6 was drafted and is now revised. 
Chapter 7 is drafted and I'm revising today and tomorrow.
After that, I only have one more chapter (plus the conclusion)!
Then I will go back and polish 4-8. Then I will submit 4-8 one by one to my advisor, and revise some more.


# Dave Rubin, Larry Elder

One of the best conversations/interviews I've ever seen between a white liberal and a black conservative. Race, welfare, free speech, and more.
Assumptions trounced at every turn. Dave Rubin continues to impress.


# It's the law of the land, stop complaining


# Electric cars

Turns out electric cars cost roughly the same as gas cars in C02, but are hugely more expensive in public dollars. I still want a Tesla but mostly because (a) it is cool and (b) it is state subsidized so you all are going to pay for it through your taxes!

# Women in the military

Nope. Nope. You may not conscript my daughter into combat service in the military. I'm very sorry, but no.

Has our country (and both parties) gone crazy?

# Evangelistic Leftism

Certain ideologies on the left -- Marxism, liberalism, political correctness -- have to expand. They are the "interfere with others" schools of thought. Like religious Christians, they have an obligation to spread the good news. Unlike religious Buddhists, they cannot simply be at peace and enjoy their own wisdom. 

This is why the fundamental divide in the west right now is not between religious and secular forces, but between "interfere" and "don't interfere." 

Consider LGBT rights movements. Because of the State's rights, the U.S. could easily allow some states (MA? CA?) to adopt more progressive policies on gay rights, including marriage, sodomy laws, public displays of affection, work place hiring requirements, private business practices, and so on. States with traditional sexual moralities could continue preserving the value of male-female marriage, reproduction, monogamy, and fidelity.
