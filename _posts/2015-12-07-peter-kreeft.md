The unconventional career of [Peter Kreeft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kreeft). He is a teaching philosopher and popular writer (inspired by the likes of C. S. Lewis) who has produced memorable and influential works on ageless themes, such [as the existence of God, the problem of evil, miracles, and heaven.](http://peterkreeft.com/featured-writing.htm)

His ["Socrates meets..." series](http://www.peterkreeft.com/books.htm) successfully resurrects the Platonic dialogue format as a humorous and logically rigorous presentation of arguments about individual thinkers or ideologies.

His latest nonfiction work, the [*Summa Philosophica*](http://www.amazon.com/Summa-Philosophica-Peter-Kreeft/dp/1587318253) applies St. Thomas' disputatio format as a humorous and logically rigorous presentation of arguments about 100 of the most fundamental questions in life.
