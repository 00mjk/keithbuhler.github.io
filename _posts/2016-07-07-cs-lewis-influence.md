When discussing C. S. Lewis one day, I realized I have only anecdotal information on his influence.  

How many Christians became or remained Christians, in part, because of C. S. Lewis? How many non-Christians read Lewis? Internet Infidels devotes some space to Lewis take downs (*Miracles, Abolition of Man, Mere Christianity,* and others) 

Well, here's some data! 80+ people have taken my C.S. Lewis survey: Join them [to see the results.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RH5VTHRmZsvw6Yqyz8vfnm5Uw4OvylD3omcFIa3lYgc/viewform?usp=send_form)
