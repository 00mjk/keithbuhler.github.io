Wait, if the Ghostbusters backlash was because America/the World doesn't want female leads, then why is Wonder Woman 3/5ths of the way to a billion dollars? (And what's up with Force Awakens? Rogue One?) The sexism narrative doesn't fit the facts. 


What's a better narrative, then? Here's a try: Maybe Ghostbusters (2016) was just a semi-funny, artistically safe, politically touchy, slightly subversive REBOOT of a beloved classic when the fanbase was actually craving long awaited third installment. Yes?
