### Course Description: 
Who are you? Where does the world come from? This course is an exercise in answering these questions by practicing a different way of thinking. We will think deeply about the world, God, death, science, logic, language, and our own selves. 

We will also learn some facts of history, vocabulary words, philosophical concepts, and big names. But our main task is to *think*. We will think slowly, carefully, methodically, and deeply about important things, such as our own identity, the existence of God, the structure of the cosmos, and the moral law. At times, you will *probably* be confused. You will *certainly* be challenged. You *may* be changed forever.

Every week we will read, write about, and discuss a primary source from western history. You will get better at reading actively,  discussing intentionally and writing logically. These skills are not just useful for philosophy. They will make you better in computer programming or chemistry, better in motherhood or the ministry. (The top five most coveted job skills are communication, teamwork, critical thinking, and creativity, and self-discipline.)

Most importantly, this new way of thinkig will help us love God with all our minds. We will become more connected, integrated, thoughtful, reflective human beings.  The ultimate motivation for having the conversation we call philosophy must be that it can make us better. We are also entering into the Great Conversation with our own, often confused thoughts, becoming part of the Conversation, and being forever changed. 

**Our goals then are:**

* To read, comprehend, evaluate and discuss difficult philosophical arguments.
* To become familiar with the thought of major philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, and to understand the major questions they seek to answer.
* To understand the Christian answers to questions about the meaning of life, the structure of the cosmos, the possibility of scientific knowledge, and the ground of morality, as contrasted with metaphysical naturalism, nihilism, and deism.
* To practice reflect thinking upon our own lives, beliefs, attitudes, culture, and goals, in order to become more thoughtful human beings in the pursuit of goodness, truth, and beauty.

### Scope and Sequence:
To accomplish our goals, each (2-week) Unit consists of readings, quizzes, discussion and writing, and possibly a paper. There is a midterm and final.

### Grading:

You will be graded equally on each component, plus applicable extra credit.

|  Assessment category              |  Percent of semester grade |
| ----------------------------------|----------------------- |
| Readings (Quizes)                 | 25%  |  
| Participation (Talking, writing)  | 25% |
| Tests (Midterm, Final)            | 25% |
| Disputation Papers                | 25% |
| Extra Credit                      | 3% (max) |

I typically do not round up. So 89.5 is a “B”

Letter Grade | Percentage
|-----------------|-------------|
| A  | 99%-90%     |
| B | 89%-80%      |
| C  | 79% - 70%   |
| D   | 69% - 60%  |
| F  | < 59%         |

Your best bet for getting an ‘A’ is to (a) read carefully every week, (b) attend and participate in class through talking and/or writing, (c) study hard for the tests, and (d) write the Papers according to the given instructions.

### Readings

The primary work if this class (about 3 hours a week) will be reading and understanding these books. Real books are harder, but more interesting, than a textbook. Read actively, read ahead, and try to understand the book. Reading tips are online. 


### Quizzes
Short reading quizzes will assess whether your eyeballs hit the page and whether you comprehended what you read. These will be completed on Discovery and will typically consist of a few multiple-choice questions on the reading for the day. These quizzes are due before class on the day when the corresponding reading assignment is due. There is a time limit on these quizzes and they can only be taken once, so it is advisable that you complete them just as soon as you complete your reading. You will not have enough time to search the reading for the answers, but you may keep the reading assignment open to aid in the completion of the quiz. You will quickly find that you really must do the reading and do it quite carefully to do well on these quizzes.

Primarily, your goal is not just to read but to *understand*. Reflect on
what you’ve read. Bring to class a question from the reading –focus on
what confuses you. 



### Attendance:
We need you here! Attendance is mandatory. 1 to 3 "Personal absences" are freebies — no points lost. You may use them for sickness, sports, or sleep.  After that, absences must be excused. After 3 personal absences, unexcused absences will cost 2% deduction from the semester grade *per absence*. 8 unexcused absences is a letter grade and 9 will cause you to fail the class. 

1 = -0  
2 = -0  
3 = -0  
4 = -2% 
5 = -4%  
6 = -6%  
7 = -8%  
8 = -10%  (a letter grade)  
9 = -50%  

Roll will be taken each class by marking a 3x5 card.  You may check your absences at any time by requesting to see your card. (Being repeatedly or egregiously late will count as an absence.) I recommend you aim for perfect attendance to maximize your learning. You are paying for this education including this class, so why wouldn’t you make the most of it?  


### Participation through dialogue/writing:

This is a dialogue-oriented class. Every person is responsible to participate, through speaking in class and writing after class. Everyone starts at an 80% (B-) for the participation grade; you can move up from there or down, depending on whether you speak or write once per week, pay attention, and offer helpful contributions.

Class time is primarily focused on discussion of the material for which I expect you to be fully engaged. For this reason, I prohibit the use of electronic devices in class. (Laptop users must request permission and, if approved, must sit in the front of class.)

*Speaking Emphasis:* By default, everyone is an "external processor". To earn participation points, you will voluntarily share your thoughts in discussion once per week, and/or respond when called upon. You are not required to write posts on the discussion board online. 

*Writing Emphasis:* Those who opt out of speaking are "Internal procesors" and emphasize writing.  To earn participation points, you will post class reflections online every week. You may elect to speak in class as well, and may be called upon.

Come *prepared*. Read, take notes, reflect, and come ready to share your viewpoint, defend it, listen to others' viewpoints, and critique theirs.  Discussion ground rules are posted online. 


### Unit Tests: 

There are two exams: midterm and final. These exams will assess your knowledge of historical facts, philosophical definitions, and the ability to synthesize and apply concepts. The Study Guide is posted online. (Hint: it is a good idea to review past reading quizzes.)


### Disputation Papers: 

Every 2 weeks or so, you will write a 400+ word Philosophical Disputation. Each disputation is pass/fail and worth approximately 4% of the semester grade. Plagiarism – intentional or unintentional – will result in a a zero for the assignment, and jeopordizes your standing in the class. The instructions are posted online. 

### Extra Credit?
Those who opt for extra credit may do so. Instructions are posted online.

### Miscellany
1. **Bring your textbook** to every class. 
2. **Participate.** Participation is your responsibility; I may or may not call on you. Challenge yourself!
3. **Stay focused.** Do not distract yourself with side conversations, texting, Facebook, or doing anything else in class. Take a short mental break or bathroom break if you need to, but come back. (If you have an important phone call or text, please step outside the class for a moment, then return.)
4. **No smart phones.** No other electronics, laptops, iPhones, or iPads, iPods, smartphones, etc. Unplug, listen and engage.
4.  **Laptop/tablet users:** You must request permission, and if approved, sit in the front row.
5. **Be respectful of others**: Pay attention when a neighbor is talking. No teasing. Don’t pack up early. 
6.  **Contact me.** Best method is to chat after class. I read every email but may not respond to every email. You need a response, and I haven’t responded within three (3) business days, email again with the subject “nudge”. Please use keith.buhler@uky.edu rather than my Asbury email.
7.  **Contact**. For short, quick questions, use Twitter (keith\_buhler)
8.  **Email**. You are expected to have an active e-mail account that you check regularly, and to check Discovery “news”. Section related announcements will be made on Discovery “news” and/or via e-mail  (e.g. if I am sick, pointers for home work, change in due dates).
6. I can accommodate you: If you have a documented disability that might require academic accommodation, please make sure you are registered with the Academic Support Program. Contact Pam Downing (pamela.downing@asbury.edu / (859) 858-3511 x2283.
7. Make up work is not accepted after the due date, unless you obtain prior (email) permission. 
9. **Enjoy philosophy.** We are not merely solving abstract puzzles here, but digging deeply into human thinking in a way that could change your life forever. The more you and your fellows allow yourselves to acquire a “taste” for the material, the more inclined you will be to give it the real effort required to master it.

8. Also, don’t cheat. Cheating or plagiarism will result in a zero for the assignment. Cite your sources. Unintentional plagiarism is still plagiarism. Egregious instances or repeat instances will result in formal disciplinary action from the university. Also, do not intentionally take anyone else’s work nor provide your work to anyone else (under whatever auspices). Academic integrity, the embodiment of the moral and spiritual principles to which we adhere, is the essential basis of the Asbury University academic community. 


## Appendix on Academic Integrity

Integrity, as partially defined by the Student or Program Handbook on Community Life Expectations, is “both knowing the right thing to do and doing it regardless of the circumstances.” This definition may be applied to all of the scholastic interactions of the academic community. Every member of the community shares responsibility for maintaining mutual trust, respect, and integrity. Violations of such trust and specific acts of academic dishonesty will be subject to disciplinary action. 

Academic dishonesty can be defined as any type of cheating relative to a formal academic requirement. Academic dishonesty is typically thought of first as plagiarism. Plagiarism, whether intentionally or unintentionally, occurs when credit is taken for what someone else worked hard to discover and record if there is no clarification from where or from whom information is taken. Plagiarism is the use of another’s ideas, words, thoughts, or organization without appropriate credit and documentation when used for a project, paper, presentation, or exam.

More examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to: unauthorized collaborations, fabrications of data, unauthorized access to sources on an exam, excessive revision by someone other than the student, re-use of previous work without permission, and other situations described by faculty for specific purposes.

Faculty will address suspected occurrences of academic dishonesty as follows: The faculty member will meet with the student individually to discuss the incident. At the faculty member’s discretion, the department chair will either be notified of the meeting or be asked to be present for it. The student will be informed of the department chair’s involvement. At the faculty member’s discretion the student will receive a lowered grade, an F or 0% on the assignment in question. The faculty member will report the incident in writing to the Registrar who will maintain a record of academic integrity violations.If the incident is the student’s second offense of academic dishonesty as verified by the Registrar, the student will meet with the Dean of the college or school where the most recent incident occurred. At the Dean’s discretion, the student will receive an F in the course. If the incident is the student’s third offense, the student will be suspended from Asbury University. 

Students desiring to appeal a determination of academic dishonesty will follow the ‘Academic Appeals Procedure’ found in the Probation, Suspension, and Appeals section of the Asbury University Bulletin, specifically item 1. A.
