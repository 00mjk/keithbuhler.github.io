| <img src="/img/keithbuhler-golden.png"> | Hi, I'm Keith Buhler. I currently [teach philosophy and ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and at the University of Kentucky. I've been an educator for about [14 years](/Buhler-CV) and really love what I do. (Students, please visit the [philosophy portal](/philosophy).) |
|                                         | Iâ€™m in the thick writing my [dissertation](/research) on the virtue ethics of Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, and John McDowell. My research explores the relation between virtue, practical rationality, and happiness. I suspect that a defense of "natural teleology" -- properly defined -- is a key to ethical theorizing and ethical living. 
|                                         | Other problems that interest me are those in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, or philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community.
