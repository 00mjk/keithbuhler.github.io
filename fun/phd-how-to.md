title: how to get a phd in philosophy
--- 

[Another page explains my research.](/fun/phd) This post gives some advice on each stage of the process. 

### My Story  ###

In 2011, my wife and I decided to pursue a PhD in philosophy. We had just gotten married in 2010. I was finishing an M.A. in theology. I was working as a high school teacher and she was the admissions department at a new college. I knew for five years I wanted to pursue further graduate training, but now the timing was right.

We applied to 14 schools. I got 10 rejections, and 4 acceptances. U.K. was my top choice because I wanted to work with David Bradshaw, but the choice was easy. Claremont and University of Chicago offered no funding, no tuition; University of Dallas offered tuition with no funding; University of Kentucky offered tuition with funding. I accepted the offer. 

## Should you get a PhD in philosophy?


1. Do you want to go to graduate school?

This is the difficult discernment decision. Why go to grad school? [There are almost no jobs in philosophy.](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2015/02/pedigree-matters-and-prospective-students-are-entitled-to-know.html) In my opinion, you should only go to graduate school if you cannot imagine being happy doing anything else except philosophy. 

Ask your teachers for an honest appraisal of your current ability and potential. Academic philosophy has room for all kinds of interests and abilities, but you don't want to kid yourself. 

Some study philosophy and go on to other things. Some get a B.A. or even an M.A. before going into business, non-profit, or ministry. Others go "all the way" with a PhD and try to teach at a university. 


### 2. If so, MA or PHD? ##

[MAs, in general, leverage you up to better PhD programs (if you do well).](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/terminal-vs-non-terminal-ma-programs.html)  But they extend your total time to job market from average 7 years to average 9 years. The end goal is to learn a lot, hone your writing, get good recommendations (for PhD applications) or move on to your career. 

[PhDs, in general, get you on the job market in average 7 years.](http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf06312/) They often pay you to teach or research along the way. The end goal is to become a professor and/or researcher at a university. 

### 3. How do you best apply? ##

Your philosophical essay is the most important. Pick your best undergrad or MA essay, re-write it twice, polish it, send it to your favorite and most generous professor, re-write it again, pay some to proof-read it, then print it out, read it aloud with a read pen, re-write it again, THEN include it in your portfolio.

The [GRE](http://www.ets.org/gre) is necessary, but not life or death. Philosophers tend to do well on the math. But you should study harder for the verbal and writing, as this counts more than math. (Math is more important for, say, engineering grad students). 

[Personal statements?](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2007/09/advice-on-perso.html) Not sure how important they are. No one has ever told me they *make* a candidate; but it seems commonsense that they can *break* a candidate. Play it safe -- just be calm, be yourself, be frank, and say what you want to study. Your aspirations will change; just state what you want to study *today*. 


### 4. Once you get in, how do you best make progress? ###
At U. Kentucky, there are 35 steps from admission to "congratulations Doctor". So I've [made a list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RqZIRaApZnbUcbipRMALKwz1FTuKLeRoB529OZpdbeA/edit?usp=sharing)

The list is 35 or so items, broken into 6 (very disproportionally sized) projects: 

1. Complete 12 classes.                                                2 years

2. Complete language, logic, and Comprehensive exams 2-3 years

3. Write and defend an Area Proposal.                          6 months

4. Write and defend three Qualifying Exams.                 3 weeks

5. Write and defend a Dissertation Proposal.                 6 months?

6. Write and defend a Dissertation.                                2 years




### 5. How do you approach coursework? ##


The first step was to complete my coursework. I took 2-3 classes per semester for 2.5 years. 

My approach is to hit hard early, and ease up later. I took three classes (two seminars) the first semester. This was hard, but you adjust to the work load. Manage your time. It's like jumping in a cold pool head first. You adjust quicker. 

I took three seminars the third semester and that got me ahead, which has been nice. 

My program requires a "Teaching Proseminar" to help us be good little graduate TA proletariat wage slaves. I did that the first semester too. My professor made a throw-away class something actually useful. 



### 6. Language, Logic, and Comprehensive exams? ##

Pick the language in which you will eventually read primary sources: usually either Greek, Latin, French, or German -- but of course sometimes Spanish, or whatever language you might be working in. Also, U. Kentucky requires symbolic logic, so I took that my third year. 

Comprehensive exams are required at U. Kentucky but the practice is fading. I studied for a whole semester or summer before the test, reading primary sources and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Internet Encyclopedias of Philosophy. Rest well on the day of the exam, bring snacks, pace yourself, and write like the wind. 



### 7. How do you decide on an Area? ##

Naturally, each school is different. Some have you write a Prospectus or Dissertation Proposal rather than stretching the process out like U.Kentucky does. We do an Area, then Qualifying Exams, then Proposal -- THEN start the dissertation.


### 8. How do you pass the Qualifying Exams? ##

This is simply a matter of doing the reading in your area. Take notes as you go -- quotations (with full citation information or you will regret it!) and sentences or paragraphs in your own words. These many, many notes will serve as raw material when you begin writing exams and chapters. 


### 10. How do you write a dissertation? ##

[Start by reading this awesome instruction set from Proffessor Robert Paul Wolff](http://robertpaulwolff.blogspot.com/2010/07/how-to-write-doctoral-dissertation-in.html)

The plan right now is to write one page per day, every day, 7 days a week, until draft 1 is done. "Done" df = 6 chapters, 40 pages each, 12,000 words each, for 72,000 words total and about 280 pages.


One good structure idea:

* 4-6 chapters
+ 30-50 pages each
+ 120-300 pages total. 
+ 8,000 - 12,000 words or so per chapter
+ 50,000-62,000 words total. 

This would look like: 

+ Chapter 1:  Introduction, thesis, key premises, assumptions, methodology, flow of arguments, and outline of dissertation
+ Chapter 2: Literature review; background on your topic/authors.
+ Chapter 3: Arguments 1
+ Chapter 4: Arguments 2
+ Chapter 5: Arguments 3, etc
+ Chapter 6: Conclusion - Reminder of thesis, summary of arguments.



#### A bit more detail ###
A bit more detail: Your dissertation will be between 150-300 pages long. It will be minimum 4 chapters, maximum probably 8. Each chapter will be minimum 20 pages, maximum 80 pages. Each chapter will be minimum 10,000 words, maximum 20,000 words. Then you are done. 

Example 1 - 250 pages, 6 chapters, 41 pages each, 10,020 words per chapter. 
Example 2 - 200 pages, 5 chapters, 40 pages each, 10,000 words per chapter.
Example 3 - 300 pages, 5 chapters, 60 pages each, 15,000 words per chapter. 
Example 4 - 300 pages, 8 chapters, 37 pages each, 9,200 words per chapter.
