# Bio #

Thanks for reading. My academic quest in life is to become wise. Along the way, I want to expose errors in reasoning wherever I find them, in my enemies, my friends, and myself. 

I'm the youngest of seven kids. I was born in Los Alamitos, CA and grew up in [greater Los Angeles and Orange County](https://screen.yahoo.com/californians-drama-off-405-000000032.html). I was homeschooled for many years, attending some high school until I went to college a year early. 
 
I discovered philosophy through studying history. While my current research focuses on contemporary analytic virtue ethics, this introduction has left an indelibly mark on my approach to philosophical issues. 

The Torrey Honors Institute in CA forced me to read the "great books", including philosopy, literature, science, history, theology, and more. So my bias is toward "classics" like Plato's *Republic*, the *Tao Te Ching*, and Aquinas *Summa Theologica*. Of contemporary philosophers, I admire Thomas Nagel, Alasdair MacIntyre, Rosalind Hursthouse, Richard Swinburne, JP Moreland, Alan Gibbard, John McDowell, John Haldane, and Hilary Putnam, among others.

I changed from a Psychology major/Art minor to a Humanities with an emphasis in History and minor in Biblical studies. I got the most out of studying Plato with John Mark Reynolds of Biola Unviersity, And with Al Geier of Rochester University ([Zeus in human form](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=190830)). Geier's method of dialectical exercise formed my pedagogy in my own classes. 

Then, I studied metaphysics and philosophy of mind with [J. P. Moreland](http://www.jpmoreland.com/) at Talbot Graduate School. Here I became disgruntled with metaphysical naturalism as a common prejudice in analytic philosophy. Eventually, I settled into teaching philosophy as a master tutor at the Torrey Academy and earned an [M. A. in Applied Orthodox Theology](http://www.antiochian.org/studies/st-stephens-ma-program) at the University of Balamand.  
 
After marrying Lindsay, we decided it was time to get a [PhD](http://keithbuhler.github.io/fun/phd). We moved to Kentucky in 2012, so it's my first time out of the country. We had a baby, and started school that week. Things have been less crazy since. 
 
My current advisor, David Bradshaw, works "on the ways that ancient Greek philosophy shaped medieval philosophy and religious thought, and how these, in turn, contributed to the formation of modernity." 

My current [research](/research) centers on questions of virtue ethics.
