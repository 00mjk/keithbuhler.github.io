Thanks for reading. My academic quest in life is to become wise. Along the way, I want to expose rational and moral errors in myself, in my enemies, in my friends, or wherever I find them.

I'm the youngest of seven kids, born and raised in [greater Los Angeles area.](https://screen.yahoo.com/californians-drama-off-405-000000032.html). I was homeschooled for many years. 
 
I went to college a year early and The Torrey Honors Institute forced me to read the "great books", including philosopy, literature, science, history, theology, and more. 

A historical, traditional approach made an indelible mark on my approach to philosophical issues. So my bias is toward "classics" like Plato's *Republic*, the *Tao Te Ching*, and Aquinas *Summa Theologica*. 

Of course, I also admire many contemporary philosophers: Thomas Nagel, Alasdair MacIntyre, Rosalind Hursthouse, Richard Swinburne, JP Moreland, Alan Gibbard, John McDowell, John Haldane, and Hilary Putnam, and many others. 

Due to my growing interest in the Great Books, I changed from a Psychology major/Art minor to a Humanities/History major. I took modern philosophy and ethics classes but learned most most studying Plato with John Mark Reynolds and with Al Geier of Rochester University ([Zeus in human form](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=190830)). Geier's method of dialectical exercise most of all has formed my pedagogy in my own classes. 

After completing my B. A., I got a job appraising houses but read voraciously, still mostly "old books": Plotinus, the complete works of Plato, Proclus, Aquinas. I applied and was accepted to study philosophy at the M.A. level. I took metaphysics and philosophy of mind with [J. P. Moreland](http://www.jpmoreland.com/) at Talbot Graduate School. During this time, I became disgruntled with metaphysical naturalism, which is sadly a common prejudice in analytic philosophers.

Eventually, I switched my study from philosophy to theology, earning an [M. A. in Applied Orthodox Theology](http://www.antiochian.org/studies/st-stephens-ma-program) at the University of Balamand.  By that time, however, I was a full-time teacher of humanities in a secondary school called the Torrey Academy. 

My current research focuses on contemporary analytic virtue ethics. 
 
After marrying Lindsay, we decided it was time to get a [PhD](http://keithbuhler.github.io/fun/phd). We moved to Kentucky in 2012, so it's my first time out of the country. We had a baby the same week school started. Things have been less crazy since. 
 
My current advisor, David Bradshaw, works "on the ways that ancient Greek philosophy shaped medieval philosophy and religious thought, and how these, in turn, contributed to the formation of modernity." 

My current [research](/research) centers on questions of virtue ethics.
