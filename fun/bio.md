# Bio #

Thanks for reading. I'm the youngest of seven kids. I was born in Los Alamitos, CA and grew up in Los Angeles and Orange county, which is why I am [uncultured](https://screen.yahoo.com/californians-drama-off-405-000000032.html). I was homeschooled, which is why I am pale. 
 
My academic quest in life is to become wise and virtuous, and to present a contemporary version of Aristotelian and Platonic moral and intellectual virtues that academics and others can find compelling. 
 
I studied humanities as an undergraduate, especially Plato with John Mark Reynolds of Biola Unviersity and with Al Geier of Rochester University ([Zeus in human form](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=190830)). The dialectical exercise of these classes has formed my pedagogy in my own classes. Then, I studied metaphysics and philosophy of mind with [J. P. Moreland](http://www.jpmoreland.com/) at Talbot Graduate School. Here I became disgruntled with metaphysical naturalism as a common prejudice in analytic philosophy. Eventually, I settled into teaching philosophy as a master tutor at the Torrey Academy and earned an [M. A. in Applied Orthodox Theology](http://www.antiochian.org/studies/st-stephens-ma-program) at the University of Balamand.  
 
After marrying Lindsay, we decided it was time to get a [PhD](http://keithbuhler.github.io/fun/phd). We moved to Kentucky in 2012, so it's my first time out of the country. We had a baby, and started school that week. Things have been less crazy since. 
 
I'm currently conducting doctoral research on the concepts of virtue and practical reason in Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Robert M. Adams. My other research interests include philosophy of religion, philosophy of mind (especially imagination), and metaphysics (especially causal closure).
