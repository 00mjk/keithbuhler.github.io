[Another page gives some advice](http://keithbuhler.github.io/fun/phd-how-to) to help folks decide whether a PhD in philosophy is right for them. 

## Research Proposals ##

At U. Kentucky we complete coursework and then make three progressively specific proposals. 

2. The [Area Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CYQDZ8AWu8eHVtdkY5RVFVbWs/view) explains the sub-discipline within philosophy I find interesting. 
3. The [Qualifying Exams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CYQDZ8AWu8Y21MZnVxR1g3cFU/view) prove I have read quite a bit in my sub-discipline and am ready to start researching and writing in that area. 
4. The [Dissertation Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CYQDZ8AWu8ZWpPVG5lS2V4RGM/view) "pitches" my specific project. With that approved, I began writing.
