## My Story

Good evening and welcome. My name is Keith Buhler I am one of the new instructors for the 2013 year and I'll be teaching the inklings mere Christianity for modern's for ninth through 12th graders and little also has asked me to say a few words about classical education. I wanted to give you a few comments and stories about why classical education is so important right now at this point in history in American history, and history of odds church and now that you're here perhaps in your family.

There a lot of resources to learn more about what classical education is and so I want to give you a couple of comments that are sort of an overview. What's the point what's the big picture for those of you who are already familiar. Maybe this can be that five 50,000 foot flyover to remind you why we're doing this even though it's harder even though our friends don't necessarily understand even though it takes work, even though your child may not understand. I'm speaking mostly to parents here, but this is addressed that you why are you here and for those who aren't familiar at all. Maybe you're here on recommendation maybe a friend said oh you have to check this out then this will give you a snapshot something to motivate further research.


So important right now at this point in history in American history, and history of odds church and now that you're here perhaps in your family.

In my experience classical education has three main distinctives. I was homeschooled myself through most of my precollege education. 

I went to high school but I left early. (Students don’t tell your parents that your teacher dropped out of high school!)

The high school counselor, God bless him, asked me what I wanted in a college and all I knew was that I did not want high school part two. 

I always loved reading because my mom taught me to read. She put lots of books in the house and I was always reading. 

## Torrey Honors Program. 

What experiences not just some good books. What experiences a whole person transformation. It was an emotional shift the spiritual shift and intellectual shift a social shift in my life and new friends with whom I could talk about new ideas in a sense I was estranged from my family Intel I could find the words to explain what was going on inside of me. They had no idea and I was falling in love, not just with books. 

But with truths and realities perhaps most importantly, I was coming to learn what Christians believe and why and how I fell short, we often say a good thing to do is to learn what you believe and why. And that's true so far as it goes, but I didn't really believe it, but I didn't even know. I didn't really believe it and I didn't know why it's not that I had tried Christianity and it was found wanting. It said it was found difficult and I didn't even try. 

Now I was exposed to the best secular thinking the best pagan thinking, yes even the best anti-Christian thinking Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Marx Immanuel Kant and I was able to see for the first time that the Christian view of truth. In fact, Christ himself. Christ's worldview, if you will wins in the market of ideas and to see how unique the Christian view. Actually it's we're not making this stuff up smart Christians of either discovered these truths the best interpretation of of God and man in the universe. The past the present and the future or got himself a stepped in and said let dice you not getting it but me explain how the creation happened and we take this and we try to understand it. And we deepen it. We take the revelation we received and this is the truth and within the Christian community across all time up to the present moment and continuing on in the next generation. There's a fence outside which we know that there's error and sin and falsehood, and within which there some room to play. There's ideas we can banter about on the philosopher so like analyzing concepts all the concepts that I analyze are all that important so that some of its cow like doing a puzzle in some of its dangerous some of its I might have to take a class in a graduate program and analyze really, really wicked ideas like suppose there is no morality I guess that could be true but it's dangerous to think about the dangers to consider it and yet professionally and personally I'm interested in looking at that and coming to the answer, yes there is morality and this can be argued both from science, see Richard Dawkins. Thank you, delete that from philosophy see Thomas Aquinas and Descartes and even Plato himself and from theology in so it classical education context. My education became real life. It wasn't books go to school and learn some lessons and then go out into the big world and and see what life's really all about. It was let's bring real life into school and begin to practice on some of these big ideas. These dangerous ideas, these life-saving ideas. These truths from wherever they come and save my faith and so I think that Christianity is true. Yes because my parents taught me. And also because I looked into it and also because it makes you a good person and also because people that I trust in the past testify to it and also because those who are not Christians are either not Christians for bad reasons, though Christians are hypocritical when you're not look where all hypocritical the question is what's the right standard to hold to or because they're it never looked into it they never looked into both sides.
