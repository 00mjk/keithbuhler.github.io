# The Inklings #

This page (under construction) is dedicated to the [Inklings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inklings). This group of Oxford Dons changed the world. Below are lists of their books for reference, e-texts of some books for download, a survey, and a few links. 

## Intro ##

The Inklings was a literary discussion group associated with the University of Oxford, England. Its members, mostly academics at the university, met between the 1930s and the 1950s.

The Inklings were literary enthusiasts who praised the value of narrative in fiction, and encouraged the writing of fantasy. Contrary to what has been said about the Inklings, it was not an exclusively Christian club. Although Christian values are notably reflected in their work, there were atheists, Anthroposophists and/or occultists among the members of the discussion group.

C.S. Lewis said, of Williamsâ€™s Arthurian poems: 

> *They seem to me, both for the soaring and gorgeous novelty of their technique and for their profound wisdom, to be among the two or three most valuable books of verse produced in the [twentieth] century.*
