## Draft 1 ##

Now that I have successfully defended my qualitative dissertation on the ethics of virtue and natural teleology, I am starting the next phase of my research, specifically, articulating a defense of natural teleology at the cross-section of three sub-disciplines: the metaphysics of morality, the philosophy of biology, and moral psychology. Thus far I've found that ethical reasoning is not a special, mystical mode of practical reasoning but simply that practical reasoning aims at *living well* tout court, and that "well-being" or human flourishing is a natural state. However, many puzzles arise. Just what conception of "nature" can sustain such a theory of ethics? The answer must foray into metaphysics, as well as biology and psychology. 

I have applied to 


## Draft 2 ##

I’m also currently writing my [dissertation](/research) on virtue ethics. I’m especially interested in dialoging with the neo-Aristotelians, such as Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Elizabeth Anscombe, Iris Murdoch, Rosalind Hursthouse, Martha Nussbaum, and Michael Thompson (among others). 

My research explores the relation between virtue, practical rationality, and happiness. What exactly is a virtue and what is a vice? Is rationality a virtue? Is happiness just as “natural” as health – and what do we mean by ‘natural’ anyway? Answering these questions demands an analysis of what Foot calls "natural goodness" or natural function. I suspect that a defense of "natural teleology" -- properly defined -- is a key to ethical theorizing and ethical living. 

Virtue ethicists need solid responses to a variety of objections and worries: Harman's objection to the very notion of character traits; the objection that the pursuit of virtue is selfish or egoistic; the objection from Bernard Williams and others that human nature is a "mess" and so the virtues cannot be perfections of our nature; the powerful (if vague) Darwinian objection that there are no biological "natures" anyway; Ruth Millikan's objection that an organism's proper function cannot be read off its capacities but must be known via empirical history; 

Other problems that interest me are those in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, or philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler). I've posted some papers, mostly on philosophy of mind, but one is on metaphysics and one on philosophy of religion. My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community.


## Example
Now that I have successfully defended my qualitative dissertation on video journalism, I
am starting the next phase of my research, specifically, quantitative experimental studies
of video journalism as a new media form. Thus far I’ve found that video journalism is
seen by its practitioners and institutional adopters as a news form that is distinct from
conventional television. Beyond its obvious differences in the production & delivery
process (singular versus collaborative shooting, broadband versus broadcast), video
journalism may have narrative differences that are significant in their service to the
public sphere. It’s impossible to know without further inquiry.
I’ve already designed a set of quasi-experiments that can be conducted on-line. The
protocol received approval from the University of Pennsylvania’s Institutional Review
Board. Alas, it proved “too much” to include in my dissertation, which is a qualitative
study of the practice of video journalism in a variety of institutions, such as the Voice of
America, the BBC, commercial television stations and newspapers. No overview of this
new media form exists; it became essential to write a careful analysis of the form itself
before embarking on audience reception studies. I have applied for a small grant from my
current department at the Kutztown University of Pennsylvania to start this work.
Briefly, my experiments are designed to measure the degree to which viewers of news
images and video detect and process the presence of a photographer. What are the effects
when narratives shift from third-person to first-person accounts? What are the effects of
symbols or markers that denote the institutional source of an image? Are video stories
more understandable and credible when we see and hear from the person who shot the
video?
My wish list for institutional support of my research agenda includes 1) a department that
supports both qualitative and quantitative methods, 2) an institutional review board that
operates in a timely and responsive manner, 3) computer equipment that allows for the
delivery of quasi-experimental materials on-line and 4) departmental support for grantseeking
activities.
Finally, I am an active member of two academic organizations, the Association for
Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC) and the International
Communication Association (ICA) and hope to continue my involvement in those
organizations, which o
