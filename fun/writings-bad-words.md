#On Bad Words:

**An Investigation into Cussing, Swearing, Cursing, Profanity, Obscenity, Vulgarity, “Bad Words”, and other Potty Language.**

## Introduction

"When I was a kid, I was fascinated by bad words." -Everyone
Two Questions

I used to be fascinated by bad words. Not so much anymore. Part of the fascination of bad words is the transgressive nature of using them. They are forbidden, therefore interesting. Now, no one much cares if one uses bad words, though it can lower people's opinion of you. But still a few puzzling questions remain. What puzzled me as a child and puzzles me now is two questions: what makes the Big Bad Words worse than others? And what property or properties makes bad words bad?

Take the first question: Why is “crap” a marginally bad word, absolutely forbidden in some conservative households but freely bartered in others as an acceptable alternative to “the S Word”? Why is “shoot!” not as bad as “crap” even though it much closer pheonetically (one measely vowel sound away) to the S Word?

Take the second question: There are a range of ways we use bad words: what (if anything) is the difference between cussing, swearing, cursing, making an oath, profanity, obscenity, vulgarity, and just plain ol’ bad language? In my youth, these verbs and nouns were used interchangably. Or, perhaps, at the time, I was not sensitive to the subtle distinctions. But even now I hear people use them synonymously, as if saying the S Word is swearing, cussing, and cursing, and profane. What is extension of each concept, and do they overlap? If so, where?

## An Apology

First, I must apologize for even writing this essay. Now, to us moderns an “apology” means admitting wrong and expressing your sorrow.

As for the first meaning: I’m sorry. 

But classically, an apologia means asserting you are right and defending your position.

So here goes: There are two puzzles that have bothered me when I think about bad language. If there is a question worth asking, it’s a question worth answering, even if it drags us a bit through the linguistic mud. Is this a question worth answering? I hope you will keep reading before you decide. I want to offer a speculative answer as to the different types of bad word (vulgarities, profanities, etc.). As for what makes bad words bad, I will offer a few thoughts, but really it demands a much richer and more complex study of anthropology, philology, lingustics, culture, and history.

## A bit of background

Those who will take up with interest an essay on bad words may not demand that I admit wrongdoing. Those who take it up with disgust (but continue reading for some reason) may ignore any philosophical justification and speculate as to my psychological motives. (They might posit, for instance, that the present writer suffers from a juvenile and puerile sense of humor. And they would be right.) But they might also posit a debased and desensitised imagination that does not even see the impropriety of discussing, with a pseudo-scientific detachment, potty language. They would be wrong. In order to forestall such armchair psychoanalysis, I will psychoanalyze myself to a minimal extent. I grew up in a white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant household in which my father never cussed. Once I heard my dad utter the word “damn” while under great stress, and the moment is burned into my memory. I thought perhaps the world was ending. My mom did not bide rude words like “that sucks” or “shut up” or even “oh my God.” Eventually “crap” was permitted by the sheer force of our using it, though she would frown with disapproval. In our house, words for body parts were politely medical: boys had penises, women had breasts and vaginas. My dad included the occasionally risque joke (which he called “earthy”) within his endless stream of jokes, but they were always drowned out by other cleaner jokes. We never watched the dirtiest of movies, told the dirtiest of jokes, or used foul language freely. My six siblings and I were mostly schooled at home. This limited the inevitable exposure to dirty words and concepts that results from prolonged exposure to one’s peers. My brothers, more than my schoolmates, taught me what “bad words” I knew. And the “bad words” on our sacred list of bad words was short. (Perhaps “profane list”.) With that said, I hope my little discussion can attain some scientific objectivity and achieve some scientific results.


## Bad Words

First, how many bad words are there? There are lots of bad words: rude synonyms for for feces, for coitus, for flatuation, as well as insults, curses, or racial slurs of all kinds. But I am especially interested in what is typically called “cussing”.

But we are not talking about all bad words. We are talking about “cussing.” Those are, first and foremost, the Big Five.

The Big Five “cuss words” that are censored on television are, of course, Ass, Dn, Sh, B****, and F. (George Carlin’s list includes: piss, tit, and csucker as well). More broadly, cussing includes a host of other potty words that are just slang for body parts, like “d***” and “c****”. (A Christmas Story* calls the F word the “big one, the queen mother of dirty words.” But, as far as I can tell, the C word is worse right now than even the F word.) More broadly still, there are a host of combined words: Godd****, dumba**, motherf***er, sh**faced, piece of s***, b****slap, and so on. Of course, Shakespeare could do much worse with much prettier words.

That in mind, a bad word is, at least, a word that is bad. How can a word be bad? Consider badness as a whole. There are, in general, at least four distinct kinds of badness:

Moral badness, which applies only to people (it’s not really a bad “bad dog”.);

Instrumental badness, which applies to anything with a function – a bad clock doesn’t tell the correct time except twice a day. A bad car doesn’t run, or isn’t comfortable to drive in while it does. If the dog is supposed to guard the house, and he merely whines at strangers, then he is indeed a bad dog in this sense. A soldier who is a coward is bad in an instrumental (not just a moral!) sense – since he is useless.

There is also aesthetic badness: ugliness. Even something, like a vase or painting, something without a moral character, and without a particular function (at least not one that is as cut and dry as the function of knives, guarddogs, and soldiers) could be a bad painting. (I think bad smells fall into this category? What smells so bad? Oh, the trash has a rotten banana in it).

Finally, something can be epistemically bad – as in mistaken or false, like a bad answer to the question “what is 3x3?” or a bad call by a football referee.

So what kind of bad are bad words? The most plausible guess is that bad words are morally bad and aesthetically bad.


Take moral badness first. When someone regularly uses foul language, we might be inclined to judge their character as defective on that basis alone. For instance, I read once in a spiritual text that one of the “daughters” of lust is “dirty jokes.” In other words, making excessive sexual jokes arise from the same defect of character as the actual commission of illicit sexual acts. (Not, of course, that they are morally identical or even comparable – rather, they are psychologically related.) You may not agree with this diagnosis, but the point is that we do tend to judge ourselves and others by what we say, regardless of whether or not we underscore that defect by action. We might judge a potty-mouth teenager to be a certain sort of teenager (rebellious, dishonorable, dishonest) merely on the basis of his choice of dress, haircut, and language. We may be wrong in such a snap judgment, but all I need for my argument at this point is for you to concede that we make it. When we see somone who does not seem capable of constructing a sentence that lacks either the F or the S word we judge to be a bad person in some sense, without ever having witnessed him disrespect his parents or cheat on an exam or steal booze.



But on this account, are the words bad words? Or is the speaker bad by using them? The two (the speaker and the speech) are certainly related. So there are three possible answers: 1) the words themselves are bad and thus have a causal role in making the speaker bad, in “dragging him down.” 2) the words are neither bad nor good, but the speaker only uses them because he is bad. 3) The words are bad, but the speaker is not bad – he is just using a bad word.


The other plausible answer is that bad words are “aesthetically bad.” They are “foul” like a “foul stench” or a “foul ball.” They are “out of bounds” – inappropriate, repugnant, obnoxious. They are a fly in the ointment, a discordant note in the otherwise lovely melody. On this account, the words are bad in context of the sentence, the speech or conversation, the interlocuters, the setting, time, and place that the words are uttered. A word like “skeleton” can be a “bad word” if it is ill-used at a polite dinner party. A medical (and not slang) word like “diarhea” can be a “bad word” in the context of a graduation speech.




The best guess I can offer to make sense of this is that bad words are first and foremost bad aesthetically. Bad words, cuss words, are ugly words. They are useful for ugly purposes (like exclaiming, cursing, or shocking) but they cannot gracefully adorn gentle and noble purposes. Secondly, bad words can be bad morally and reflect the badness of the speaker. The relation between aesthetic ugliness and moral badness is a complex one. A dingy, disgusting drug dealer’s den is both dirty and despicable… but some beautiful things are wicked (billboards) and some ugly things are noble (wrinkly old women).


## Cussing versus Swearing, and more

Now I shall offer an analysis of different activities that need to be distinguished.

#### Cussing

Cussing appeared in the English language around 1771. To cuss is like “to curse” but not necessarily as strong as just cursing. Being a cuss is not necessarily being someone who cusses.

#### Swearing

To swear is to make an oath. It is not necessarily to use a dirty word. “By the Beard of Zeus!” says Will Ferrell’s character Ron Burgendy in "Anchorman", as well as “Spear of Odin!” These are playful oaths. Jesus’ example in the Bible is “By heaven!” and “By earth!” – as in, “By heaven, I will climb that mountain if it’s the last thing I do,” is swearing, but uses no dirty words.

#### Cursing

To curse is not to swear, nor to use vulgarity, nor obscenity. It may be (always) profane to curse, but the words used need not be profanities. Example: “I hope you die,” or “May your interview be a complete disaster,” is a curse, but includes no bad words. Of the Big Five, two are definitely commonly used in cursing: "damn you!" is a serious curse, but often used playfully. And our culture's favorite and most deadly serious curse is the relationship-ending “f*** you”! Others in the Big Five are only woven into curses by creative license. (“I hope you die you piece of s***”)

#### Vulgarity

A vulgarity is synonomous, in my opinion, with “dirty” or “bad” in the aesthetic sense – low, unrefined. The “vulgar” social class as opposed to the refined social class are not morally bad, but enjoy too much salty foods, cheap thrills, simple music, simple stories, and so on. Vulgar language is language of the vulgar class, the dockworker, the construction worker, the truck driver, the garbageman. It is rough, unpoetic, and covers fluidly the range of topics in life that are darker or dirtier. Of the Big Five, s** and piss are vulgar in the more literal sense; they refer to gross bodily substances. All five are vulgar in the cultural sense, that their use tends to signify a speaker of lower class.

#### Obscenity

Obscene is closer to vulgar but includes the edge of the erotic or “adult.” Howl was judged to be criminially obscene. “Tits” “c***sucker” and “f***” are obscence, but so is “screw” (used a a verb).

#### Profanity

Profanity is a word or phrase that is either actively irreverent to God, or merely lacking in some amount of due reverence.

## Conclusion

My two questions were: what different ways to we use bad words? And what makes bad words bad, and what makes some bad words worse than others? My answer is that bad words (and their use) are bad aesthetically: they are ugly. They or their use can only be called bad morally after a difficult analysis of the relation between ugliness and immorality, which I have not attempted here.

And I have distinguished six ways we use bad words, corresponding to their various titles (swearing versus uttering obscenities).

None of this solves the really interesting philological first question about how bad words arise and acquire their badness. But I hope it helps the curious among us know when, why, and exactly how to use – or not use – bad words.
