## Writing Tools ##

* [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php)
Scrivener is the best writing software I know of. It is useful for academic work, fiction, novels, screenplays, you name it. 

* [Words to pages](http://wordstopages.com/)

This tool helps you estimate how many pages your paper will be, how long it will take to read outloud (useful for presentations), how long it will take to read, etc. 

* [xkcd Simple Writer](https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/)
This tool helps you write using only the 1000 most common words. A good exercise for testing how well you understand a thing. 

* [Markdown preview](http://dillinger.io/)

If you write in Markdown, or want to learn, this site is an easy way to instantly preview your Markdown code. 

* [HTML to Markdown](https://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/)

This tool helps you convert your current HTML webpage to markdown, or see how other pages would look. 

* [Table to Markdown](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)



## How do you write beautiful papers? ##

+ Newbs -- I recommend [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php)  to write in plain text and "compile" (export) to .Docx or PDF. Beautiful. It's $40 and worth $400. 

+ Intermediates -- I recommend using [Texts.io](http://www.texts.io/) to code in Markdown, exporting to .docx or PDF. Beautiful. It's free. Requires about 30-90 minutes to learn Markdown syntax and become comfortable with it.  

+ L33T h@ckerz: I recommend Sublime Text (3), Pandoc, Bibdesk, and PDFLatex -- all free but requires SOME programming competence. I am working on simple written instructions with accompanying video. Once you get it down it makes beautiful, lovely, amazing, awesomely formatted papers.
