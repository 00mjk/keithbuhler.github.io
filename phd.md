### Research Proposals ###

The University of Kentucky asks graduate students to make three increasingly specific proposals.

1. The [Area Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CYQDZ8AWu8eHVtdkY5RVFVbWs/view) explains the sub-disciplines of philosophy (metaethics, naturalism, virtue ethics) I am to read in.
2. The [Qualifying Exams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CYQDZ8AWu8Y21MZnVxR1g3cFU/view) prove I have read quite a bit in these sub-disciplines and am ready to start researching and writing in that area. 
3. The [Dissertation Proposal](pending) "pitches" my specific project: to defend an account of virtue, practical reason, and happiness drawing on three  contemporary virtue ethicists. [(First draft here)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CYQDZ8AWu8ZWpPVG5lS2V4RGM/view)
