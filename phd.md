This is how I got my PHD. The next page [gives some advice](http://circularreason.github.io/phd-how-to) to help you decide if you should go for a PhD in philosophy. 

### My Story  ###

In 2011, my wife and I decided to pursue a PhD in philosophy. We had just gotten married in 2010. I was finishing an M.A. in theology. I was working as a high school teacher and she was the admissions department at a new college. I knew for five years I wanted to pursue further graduate training, but now the timing was right.

We applied to 14 schools. I got 10 rejections, and 4 acceptances. U.K. was my top choice because I wanted to work with David Bradshaw, but the choice was easy. Claremont and University of Chicago offered no funding, no tuition; University of Dallas offered tuition with no funding; University of Kentucky offered tuition with funding. I accepted the offer. 

At U. Kentucky, there are 35 steps from admission to "congratulations Doctor". So I've [made a list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RqZIRaApZnbUcbipRMALKwz1FTuKLeRoB529OZpdbeA/edit?usp=sharing). 

1. The first step was to complete my coursework. I took 2-3 classes per semester for 2.5 years. 
2. The second step was to do my three proposals. First, the [Area Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CYQDZ8AWu8eHVtdkY5RVFVbWs/view) explains the sub-discipline within philosophy I find interesting. 
3. Secondly, after reading quite a bit in my area, I wrote the [Qualifying Exams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CYQDZ8AWu8Y21MZnVxR1g3cFU/view). These prove I am ready to start researching and writing in that area. 
4. Thirdly, the [Dissertation Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CYQDZ8AWu8ZWpPVG5lS2V4RGM/view) "pitches" my specific project. 
3. With that approved, I began writing. These are very early drafts, so please do not share or cite.
