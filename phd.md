[Another page gives some advice](http://circularreason.github.io/phd-how-to) to help you decide if you should go for a PhD in philosophy. This page tells my story and presents my research proposals and early drafts of my dissertation research.

## How I got my PHD. 

At U. Kentucky, there are 35 steps from admission to "congratulations Doctor". So I've [made a list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RqZIRaApZnbUcbipRMALKwz1FTuKLeRoB529OZpdbeA/edit?usp=sharing). The first step was to complete my coursework. I took 2-3 classes per semester for 2.5 years. 



## Research Proposals ##
The second step was to do my three proposals. 

2. The [Area Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CYQDZ8AWu8eHVtdkY5RVFVbWs/view) explains the sub-discipline within philosophy I find interesting. 
3. Secondly, after reading quite a bit in my area, I wrote the [Qualifying Exams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CYQDZ8AWu8Y21MZnVxR1g3cFU/view). These prove I am ready to start researching and writing in that area. 
4. Thirdly, the [Dissertation Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0CYQDZ8AWu8ZWpPVG5lS2V4RGM/view) "pitches" my specific project. With that approved, I began writing.
