## 1. Do you want to go to graduate school? ##

This is the difficult discernment decision. Why go to grad school? There are no jobs in philosophy. 


## 2. If so, MA or PHD? ##

MAs, in general, leverage you up to better PhD programs (if you do well).  But they extend your total time to job market from average 7 years to average 9 years. 

PhDs, in general, get you on the job market in average 7 years and pay you to teach or research along the way. But 



## 3. How do you best apply? ##

The GRE is necessary, but not life or death. Study harder for the verbal and writing, as this counts more than math. (Math is for engineering grad students). 

Your philosophical essay is the most important. Pick your best undergrad or MA essay, re-write it twice, polish it, send it to your favorite and most generous professor, re-write it again, pay some to proof-read it, then print it out, read it aloud with a read pen, re-write it again, THEN include it in your portfolio.

Personal statements? Not sure how important they are. No one has ever told me they *make* a candidate; but it seems commonsense that they can *break* a candidate. Play it safe -- just be calm, be yourself, be frank, and say what you want to study. Your aspirations will change; just state what you want to study *today*. 




## 4. Once you get in, how do you best make progress? ##

To get a PhD at my school requires accomplishing six (very disproportionally sized) tasks. 



1. Complete 12 classes.                                                2 years

2. Complete language, logic, and Comprehensive exams 2-3 years

3. Write and defend an Area Proposal.                          6 months

4. Write and defend three Qualifying Exams.                 3 weeks

5. Write and defend a Dissertation Proposal.                 6 months?

6. Write and defend a Dissertation.                                2 years



So, just make a [checklist](link). And planned my registration and teaching accordingly. 



## 5. How do you approach coursework? ##

My approach is to hit hard early, and lean up later. I took three classes, two seminars the first semester. This was hard, but you adjust to the work load. Manage your time. It's like jumping in a cold pool head first. You adjust quicker. 

My program requires a "Teaching Proseminar" to help us be good little graduate TA proletariat wage slaves. I did that the first semester too. My professor made a throw-away class something actually useful. 



## 6. Language, Logic, and Comprehensive exams? ##

Pick the language in which you will eventually read primary sources: usually either Greek, Latin, French, or German -- but of course sometimes Spanish, or whatever language you might be working in. Also, U. Kentucky requires symbolic logic, so I took that my third year. 

Comprehensive exams are required at U. Kentucky but the practice is fading. I studied for a whole semester or summer before the test, reading primary sources and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Internet Encyclopedias of Philosophy. Rest well on the day of the exam, bring snacks, pace yourself, and write like the wind. 



## 7. How do you decide on an Area? ##

Naturally, each school is different. Some have you write a Prospectus or Dissertation Proposal rather than stretching the process out like U.Kentucky does. We do an Area, then Qualifying Exams, then Proposal -- THEN start the dissertation.



## 8. How do you pass the Qualifying Exams? ##

This is simply a matter of doing the reading in your area. Take notes as you go -- both quotations (with full citation information or you will regret it!) and sentences or paragraphs in your own words. These many, many notes will serve as raw material when you begin writing exams and chapters. 



## 9. How do you write beautiful papers? ##

+ Newbs -- I recommend [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php)  to write in plain text and "compile" (export) to .Docx or PDF. Beautiful. It's $40 and worth $400. 

+ Intermediates -- I recommend using [Texts.io](http://www.texts.io/) to code in Markdown, exporting to .docx or PDF. Beautiful. It's free. Requires about 30-90 minutes to learn Markdown syntax and become comfortable with it.  

+ L33T h@ckerz: I recommend Sublime Text (3), Pandoc, Bibdesk, and PDFLatex -- all free but requires SOME programming competence. I am working on simple written instructions with accompanying video. Once you get it down it makes beautiful, lovely, amazing, awesomely formatted papers. 



## 10. How do you write a dissertation? ##

[Start by reading this awesome instruction set from Proffessor Robert Paul Wolff](http://robertpaulwolff.blogspot.com/2010/07/how-to-write-doctoral-dissertation-in.html)


A good structure idea --  
+ 4-6 chapters
+ 30-50 pages each
+ 120-300 pages total. 
+ 8,000 - 12,000 words or so per chapter
+ 50,000-62,000 words total. 

+ Chapter 1: Introduction, thesis, key premises, assumptions, methodology, flow of arguments, and outline of dissertation
+ Chapter 2: Literature review; background on your topic/authors.
+ Chapter 3: Arguments 1
+ Chapter 4: Arguments 2
+ Chapter 5: Arguments 3, etc
+ Chapter 6: Conclusion

### Each chapter consists of:  ###

+ Introduction --  Chapter thesis, key premises, flow of chapter, transition from last chatper, outline of this chapter.
+ Section 2: Summary of author/topic you are responding to/critiquing/defending/discussing. (about 1/4 of chapter)
+ Section 3: Critical discussion, including objections to your author/topic. (about 1/4 of chapter)
+ Section 4: Your response, including new critiques or new arguments. (about 1/2 of chapter)
+ Conclusion -- Reminder of thesis, summary of arguments, transition to next chapter.

This post focuses on how to write the dissertation. 

Here's the bottom line: write 1 page a day (about 250 words), every day, 7 days a week, until draft one is done (200-300 days). 

A bit more detail: Your dissertation will be between 150-300 pages long. It will be minimum 4 chapters, maximum probably 8. Each chapter will be minimum 20 pages, maximum 80 pages. Each chapter will be minimum 10,000 words, maximum 20,000 words. Then you are done. 

Example 1 - 250 pages, 6 chapters, 41 pages each, 10,020 words per chapter. 
Example 2 - 200 pages, 5 chapters, 40 pages each, 10,000 words per chapter.
Example 3 - 300 pages, 5 chapters, 60 pages each, 15,000 words per chapter. 
Example 4 - 300 pages, 8 chapters, 37 pages each, 9,200 words per chapter.

My goal is this: 
Example 5 - 288 pages, 6 chapters, 48 pages each, 12,000 words per chapter. 

Break up each chapter into a month or two or three in which you will research and write that chapter. (e.g. 6 chapters, 2 months each=1 year of writing, etc.)
