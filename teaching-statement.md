#Teaching Statement

## Narrative introduction
Hi I'm Keoth. My research, my teaching. I'm working on ethics, etc. tell a story but make it a preview. 

Then the next page paragraph dissertation abstract explains it in new and different ways.

Then research statement , actually show movements Â of dissertation and show how things lead from here. Publications plans what journals or ideas.




## Experience ##

The first rule of thumb is "to focus not so much on what courses you've taught, but on how it is you go about teaching," he says. "Don't make the mistake of recapitulating what's already in your CV."


## What kind of students you've taught. 

Athletes , prep school entitled students, first generation students, excite students who know nothing of philosophy, older students,

"If you say you work to encourage collaboration in the classroom, then explain how you do that, or if you're a new teacher, how you would do that," she says. "It's easy to say, 'I want to encourage collaboration in the classroom,' or 'I want to get students to think more critically' and leave it at that. But who doesn't want to do that?"

## How I incorporate history ##
Don't Make Empty Statements

Good statements and bad statements frequently start the same (with a broad philosophical declaration), but good ones anchor the general in something concrete (in an example that one can visualize), Ms. Petrites says. Anyone can talk about teaching in an idyllic sense; you need to give examples.

## How I teach contemporary stuff ##

New teachers often devote their statements to showing that they can be innovative or that they can incorporate sophisticated concepts in a classroom, but they seldom mention how students reacted to those innovations and concepts, says Ms. Petrites of Chicago. "It's important to present a picture of yourself in a classroom with students. Otherwise readers may ask, 'Was this all about you or the students?'"



## How you solve problems
Specific problems, presented, problems solved, wide range of abilities,


## Lessons I've learned
Good teaching comes from years of trial and error, so a little humility is in order. "I'd rather read statements from candidates who talk about their mistakes and go on from there to describe how they learned from them to become better teachers," says Mr. Pannapacker.



## Pedagogy ##

"Breaking down that broad question into component parts -- for example, 
What do you believe about teaching? 

What do you believe about learning? Why?

How is that played out in your classroom? How does student identity and background make a difference in how you teach? What do you still struggle with in terms of teaching and student learning? -- is often easier," he says. "Those more concrete questions get you thinking, and then you can decide what you want to expand on."
