<h3><a id="Reading_tips_15"></a>Reading tips</h3>
<p>Read ahead. Read carefully. You will get faster, but start slow and careful. Try to read <em>and understand</em> the book or essay. Ask yourself: What is the main thesis? Is it true?  Take notes. Talk with each other before class.  Come to class with thoughts, questions. Ask yourself: What is the main point? What confused me?  More are tips <a href="http://www.keithbuhler.com/philosophy-class">available online.</a></p>
<h3><a id="Quizzes_18"></a>Quizzes</h3>
<p>Short reading quizzes assess that you read the day’s text. These are easy points, so be diligent in doing every quiz.</p>
<h3><a id="Attendance_21"></a>Attendance</h3>
<p>Attendance is mandatory; we need you here!  Roll will be taken each class by marking a 3x5 card.  (Being repeatedly or egregiously late will count as an absence.) You may check your absences at any time by requesting to see your card <em>in person</em>. I do not email attendance information. Aim for perfect attendance to maximize your learning.</p>
<p>That said, I give 2 “Personal absences”. These 2 absences may be used without penalty for <em>for any reason</em>, including emergencies, family visits, sickness, sports, or sleep. You need excuses for any other absences. The 3rd unexcused absence will cost a 2% deduction from the semester grade. This continues <em>per absence</em>. 6 unexcused absences is a letter grade and 9 will make a passing grade impossible.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 = -0</li>
<li>2 = -0</li>
<li>3 = -2%</li>
<li>4 = -4%</li>
<li>5 = -6%</li>
<li>6 = -10% (a letter grade)</li>
<li>7 = -12%</li>
<li>8 = -14%</li>
<li>9 = -50%</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="Participation_36"></a>Participation</h3>
<p>The primary competency of this class is philosophical dialogue. Hence, you must attend and participate. Class time is primarily focused on discussion of the material for which I expect you to be fully engaged.</p>
<p>We dialogue so much because: (1) You must take responsibility for your own learning. (2) We can actually get to know each other. (3) Most people learn (and retain) best in discussion. (4) Philosophy is dialogical.</p>
<p><em>You are responsible to talk in class.</em> Even if you are confused, tired, or unmotivated, I expect you to make yourself participate and engage. Get out of your comfort zone into your growth zone. Come <em>prepared</em>. Read, take notes, reflect, and come ready to share your viewpoint, defend it, listen to others’ viewpoints, and critique theirs.</p>
<p>Everyone starts at an 80% (B-) for the participation grade. You will move up or down depending on whether you pay attention and speak at least once per week. (I prohibit the use of electronic devices in class, although laptop users may request permission to sit in the front of class with their computers.) Other <a href="http://www.keithbuhler.com/discussion101">discussion ground rules are posted online.</a></p>
<p>To earn participation points, you will voluntarily share your thoughts in discussion at least once per week, and/or respond when called upon. You are not required to write posts on the discussion board online. By default, everyone is an “external processor”.</p>
<p><em>“Internal processors”</em>: Some may wish to opt out of speaking in class and emphasize writing.  To earn participation points, you will post class reflections online every week. You may elect to speak in class as well, and may be called upon.</p>
<h3><a id="Critical_Readings_50"></a>Critical Readings:</h3>
<p>You may be assigned a group “critical reading” assignment. Your group must meet <em>ahead of time</em> to read and discuss the assignment more thoroughly than your normal reading. You will then summarize the reading, analyze it, and present your own opinions. One or all of you will present your summary to the class. Instructions are posted online.</p>
<h3><a id="Test_53"></a>Test</h3>
<p>There are Quarter 1 and Quarter 3 exams. The exams might draw questions from quizzes, so pay attention to questions you may have missed. A study guide may be provided. New questions (on familiar material) may be introduced, or a new phrasing of questions  you have seen before.</p>
<h3><a id="Unit_Papers_56"></a>Unit Papers</h3>
<p>Every student will write several Unit Papers. These Unit Papers help you synthesize your own views after doing the readings and listening to lectures and participating in the discussions. This assignment is pass/fail, so follow the instructions closely. Be careful to cite your sources correctly. I will not tolerate plagiarism — unintentional or intentional.  If I detect plagiarism, I will contact you. The assignment will receive a zero, and disciplinary action may follow. The instructions are posted online.</p>
<h3><a id="Extra_Credit_59"></a>Extra Credit</h3>
<p>Those who opt for extra credit may do so. You may do extra reading, extra writing, extra class preparation. Full instructions are posted online.</p>
<h3><a id="Late_Work_64"></a>Late Work</h3>
<p>In general, I do not accept late work. Plan ahead and do work early before vacations, sports trips, or busy times. Valid excuses for turning in papers late include medical and family emergencies. That said, due dates are not eternal laws; I willing to negotiate within reason. If you are very stressed, or if I have not graded everything yet, we can talk about moving a due date. Just ask.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Bring your textbook</strong> to every class.</li>
<li><strong>Participate.</strong> Participation is your responsibility; I may or may not call on you. Challenge yourself!</li>
<li><strong>Stay focused.</strong> Do not distract yourself with side conversations, texting, Facebook, or doing anything else in class. Take a short mental break or bathroom break if you need to, but come back. (If you have an important phone call or text, please step outside the class for a moment, then return.)</li>
<li><strong>No smart phones.</strong> No other electronics, laptops, iPhones, or iPads, iPods, smartphones, etc. Unplug, listen and engage.</li>
<li><strong>Laptop/tablet users</strong> must request permission to use their device. If approved, you must sit in the front row.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful of others</strong>: Pay attention when a neighbor is talking. No teasing. Don’t pack up early.</li>
<li><strong>Contact me.</strong> Best method is to chat after class. I read every email but may not respond to every email. You need a response, and I haven’t responded within three (3) business days, email again with the subject “nudge”. Please use <a href="mailto:keith.buhler@uky.edu">keith.buhler@uky.edu</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Contact</strong>. For short, quick questions, use Twitter (keith_buhler)</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong>. You are expected to have an active e-mail account that you check regularly, and to check “news” or “announcements” section on Canvas (or Discovery, etc.). Section related announcements will be made on this platform and/or via e-mail  (e.g. if I am sick, pointers for home work, change in due dates).</li>
<li>Disabilities can be accommodated if you are registered with the Disability Resource Center. See  <a href="http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/DisabilityResourceCenter/">http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/DisabilityResourceCenter/</a></li>
<li>Make up work is not accepted after the due date, unless you obtain prior (email) permission.</li>
<li><strong>Plagiarism</strong>. Do not plagiarize. Intentional or unintentional plagiarism will result in a a zero for the assignment, and jeopardizes your standing in the class. Do not intentionally take anyone else’s work nor provide your work to anyone else (under whatever auspices). You’ll submit your papers to SafeAssign on Blackboard to help avoid accidental plagiarism. Don’t even think about stealing someone else’s thought/work.  Cite your sources. <a href="https://www.uky.edu/Ombud/What_Is_Plagiarism.pdf">See also the UK academic integrity appendix</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Enjoy philosophy.</strong> We are not merely solving abstract puzzles here, but digging deeply into human thinking in a way that could change your life forever. The more you and your fellows allow yourselves to acquire a “taste” for the material, the more inclined you will be to give it the real effort required to master it.</li>
