### Philosophy Bio ###
I discovered philosophy through studying history. While my current research focuses on contemporary analytic virtue ethics, this introduction has left an indelibly mark on my approach to philosophical issues. 

The Torrey Honors Institute in CA forced me to read the "great books", including philosopy, literature, science, history, theology, and more. So my bias is toward "classics" like Plato's *Republic*, the *Tao Te Ching*, and Aquinas *Summa Theologica*. Of contemporary philosophers, I admire Thomas Nagel, Alasdair MacIntyre, Rosalind Hursthouse, Richard Swinburne, JP Moreland, Alan Gibbard, John McDowell, John Haldane, and Hilary Putnam, among others.

I studied Plato for several years with Alfred Geier at the University of Rochester. He, more than anyone else, trained me in dialectical methodology or pedagogy. 

 My advisor is David Bradshaw, whose work on Aristotle and Eastern Patristic Fathers.
