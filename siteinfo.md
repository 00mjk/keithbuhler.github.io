title: site info
---

This website is written in a simple programming language called [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown). The Markdown coded files are converted automatically to HTML by an amazing software called [Jekyll.](https://jekyllrb.com/) The HTML is hosted for free by the open source programming community on [Github.](http://www.github.com) 

Philosopher and programming Sith Lord [Dan Sheffler](http://www.dansheffler.com) gave me the idea, the instructions, and (in some instances) the code to get started creating my own site. 

The content of this site is copyrighted by Keith Buhler 2016. All rights are reserved, with two exceptions:

(1) **Code**: You can always fork projects on Github.

(2) **Fiction**: You can use my fiction and art writings with proper ascription for your creative projects (but not for sale) under Creative Commons License. [Contact me](emailto:keithedbuhler@gmail.com) for commercial licensing or for more information.

To make your own similar website, with zero programming knowledge, will take some work. But you can do it. Start [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
