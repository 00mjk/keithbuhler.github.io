### Course Description and Learning Outcomes

**From the Course Catalog:** A study of the philosophical works of Lewis dealing with arguments for the existence of God based on human rationality, the problem of suffering, objective truth, and relation to popular culture. Includes viewing and discussion of pertinent videos.

In this course, we will read a wide selection of C. S. Lewis’s non-fiction works and two novels. Although Lewis was a philologist and not a philosopher by profession, much of his work deals with central issues in the philosophy of religion and his brilliant capacity to articulate central convictions of the Christian worldview has made him a spokesman for our faith. Further, a few of his arguments—notably those in *Miracles*—contribute genuinely new philosophical insights to the public square. We will have a chance this semester to read, evaluate, and critique both Lewis’s articulation of old truths and his account of new insights.

The expected learning outcomes for this course are: 

- to learn an appreciation for Lewis’s contribution to the Western philosophical
tradition. 
- to understand the primary questions, terminology, and
theories that present in Lewis’s philosophical milieu. 
- to learn to carefully read Lewis’s texts with a critical eye. - to gain the capacity
to communicate difficult philosophical thoughts in clear, concise
prose. 
- to connect the Lewis’s writing with ones own faith.

### Grading:

The class work consists of four components: reading, participating, and
writing. You will be graded on each component.


Assignments                            Percent of grade
 -------------------------------------- ------------------
  Reading & Quizzes                      25%
  Participation (talk, write, present)   25%
  Unit tests                             15%
  Unit Papers (pass/fail)                35%

I do not normally round. So an 89.5 is a “B.”

+------+-------------+
| A    | 100–90%     |
+------+-------------+
| B    | 89–80%      |
+------+-------------+
| C    | 79–70%      |
+------+-------------+
| D    | 69–60%      |
+------+-------------+
| E    | 59–0%       |
+------+-------------+

Your best bet for getting an ‘A’ is to (a) read carefully every week,
(b) attend and participate in class through talking and/or writing, (c)
study hard for the tests, and (d) write the Papers according to the
given instructions.

### Reading Tips

-   Read ahead.
-   Read carefully. You will get faster, but start slow and careful.
-   Try to read *and understand* the book. What is the main thesis? Is
    it true?
-   Read actively: Take notes. Talk with each other before class.
-   More tips available online.

### Quizzes

Short reading quizzes will assess whether your eyeballs hit the page and whether you comprehended what you read. These will be completed on Discovery and will typically consist of a few multiple-choice questions on the reading for the day. These quizzes are due before class on the day when the corresponding reading assignment is due. There is a time limit on these quizzes and they can only be taken once, so it is
advisable that you complete them just as soon as you complete your reading. You will not have enough time to search the reading for the answers, but you may keep the reading assignment open to aid in the completion of the quiz. You will quickly find that you really must do the reading and do it quite carefully to do well on these quizzes.

Primarily, your goal is not just to read but to *understand*. Reflect on
what you’ve read. Bring to class a question from the reading –focus on
what confuses you. 

### Attendance

We need you here! Attendance is mandatory. Roll will be taken each class by marking individual 3x5 cards. You may check your absences at any time by requesting to see your card. (Being repeatedly or egregiously late will count as an absence.) 

1 to 4 absences are freebies – whether “excused” or not they are all free -— no credit lost. After 5, each unexcused absence will cause bigger and bigger deductions from your participation grade. (8 is a full letter grade) You are paying for this education including this class, so why wouldn’t you make the most of it?

### Participation through dialogue/writing:

This is a dialogue-oriented class. Every person is responsible to participate. You are expected to participate once per week at minimum, either by writing or speaking or both. Everyone starts at an 80% for the discussion grade; you can move up from there or down, depending on whether you speak or write once per week, pay attention, and offer
helpful contributions.

Class time is primarily focused on discussion of the material for which I expect you to be fully engaged. For this reason, I prohibit the use of electronic devices in class.

*Speaking Emphasis:* “External processors” emphasize talking. You will be on my “go to” team to talk in class (instead of posting reflections after class).

*Writing Emphasis:* “Internal procesors” emphasize writing. To earn  participation points, you will post class reflections online every week. You may elect to speak in class as well, and may be called upon. 

Come *prepared*. Read, take notes, reflect, and come ready to share your
viewpoint, defend it, listen to others’ viewpoints, and critique theirs.
More “Discussion Ground Rules” are posted online.

### Critical Reading and Group Presentation

Every student will present two “critical readings.” These are days when you (or a group) summarize the assigned reading and presents your analysis. You then present your critical reading to the class. Instructions are posted online.

### Unit Tests

The first and third quarter tests will both comprise 15% of your grade and will mainly consist of factually oriented multiple choice questions concerning the reading (hint: it is a good idea to review past reading quizzes), but there will also be a handful of reflective short-answer questions.

### Unit Papers:

Every student will write 2 Unit Papers. These Unit Papers help you synthesize your own views after doing the readings and listening to lectures and participating in the discussions. Insturctions are posted online. Plagiarism – intentional or unintentional – will result in a a zero for the assignment, and jeopordizes your standing in the class.

### Extra Credit:

Those who opt for extra credit may do so. Instructions are posted online.

### Miscellany:

1.  **Bring your** textbook every day.
2.  **Participate**. Challenge yourself to talk.
3.  **No smartphones.** If you need to take a text message or phone
    call, step out, respond, and come back.
4.  **Laptop/tablet users must sit in the front row.**
5.  **Be respectful of others**: no teasing, and pay attention when a
    neighbor is talking. Don’t pack up early. Don’t come late. Don’t
    talk while your neighbor is talking.
6.  **Contact me.** Best method is to chat after class. I read every
    email but may not respond to every email. You need a response, and I
    haven’t responded within three (3) business days, email again with
    the subject “nudge”. Please use keith.buhler@uky.edu rather than my
    Asbury email.
7.  **Contact**. For short, quick questions, use Twitter (keith\_buhler)
8.  **Email**. You are expected to have an active e-mail account that
    you check regularly, and to check Discovery “news”. Section related
    announcements will be made on Discovery “news” and/or via e-mail
    (e.g. if I am sick, pointers for home work, change in due dates).
9.  Disabilities can be accommodated if you are registered with the
    Disability Resource Center. See
    http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/DisabilityResourceCenter/
10. Plagiarism has been an issue. Even unintentional plagiarism earns a
    zero for the assignment and, in intentional or egregious cases,
    failing the course and receiving a permanent mark on your academic
    record. You’ll submit your papers to SafeAssign on Blackboard to
    help avoid accidental plagiarism. Don’t even think about stealing
    someone else’s thought/work.
11. **Enjoy philosophy**. We are not merely solving abstract puzzles
    here, but digging deeply into human thinking in a way that could
    change your life forever. The more you and your fellows allow
    yourselves to acquire a “taste” for the material, the more inclined
    you will be to give it the real effort required to master it.
