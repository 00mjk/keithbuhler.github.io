# In Class

Philosophy is about arguing. Not yelling, but rationally justifying your positions and debunking falsehoods. 

Philosophy is about making arguments and understanding arguments. Philosophy is not, primarily, about memorizing historical figures, philosophical schools, and terminology. You only learn memorize those things in order to be able to understand the arguments. Then you have to think. 

Probably your class will consist of (a) reading classic texts or modern articles that make philosophical arguments, (b) listening to your professor lecture, and (c) asking questions of the teacher or discussing with each other, and (d) writing arguments in philosophical papers. 

So, to succeed, you need to learn how to do each of these activities. Don't worry if you feel uncomfortable or incompetent. Just like weight lifting or long-distance running, no one starts out good at it. You just start. You may feel weak, slow, "dumb", or confused. That's normal. Just keep swimming.

##(A) How Do I Get Better at Reading Philosophy? 
* Read ahead, slowly, re-read, and think about what you've read.
* Read ["how to read philosophy"](http://writing.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Reading-Philosophy-Concepcion-2004.pdf), by David Concepci√≥n, *Teaching Philosophy*, 27:4, December 2004.
* Read how to read a book, by Mortimer Adler.
* Use Sparknotes *sparingly*. Try to encounter the text. 
* [Try an "Intentional Reading Project"](http://www.readingintentionally.com/p/building-your-list.html)
* [More reading tips](/philosophy-tips)


## (B) How do I Get Better at Understanding these Lectures?

* Stop the professor often with questions. Philosophy is all about dialogue. 
* Write down new vocab words and look them up before the next class. 
* Talk with fellow students after class. Maybe you were both confused about the same thing; or maybe they can help. 
* Be patient with yourself. 


## (C) How Do I Get Better at Discussion?

## (D) How Do I Get Better at Writing Philosophy Papers? ####
* Learn to [argue well.](/logic)
* In general, [philosophy papers can be structured like this.](https://sites.google.com/a/wellesley.edu/pinkguidetophilosophy/how-to-write-1)
* For my classes, the [disputation](/disputation) format works well.



#### I'm Interested in Learning More about a Particular Philosopher or Topic; Where Should I Start? ####
* Read the [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/) article for medium difficulty introductions to any topic, thinker, or school of thought. Much better than just googling it!
* If you want a more rigorous version of the same, read the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/).
