# The Humdrum Rebellion: A Call to Arms.

*“Yes, things are bad in the world…. But let us rejoice, let us have hope,  because while they can take everything from us, they cannot rob us of our  death.”* - An anonymous monk.

It is becoming increasingly clear that we live in strange, monumental, and volatile times. With the advent of social media, our world is constantly getting smaller and larger simultaneously. We are aware in newer, faster, broader ways of the events currently taking place around the globe. Thus, there are few of us who have not heard at least something of the Libyan victory over tyranny, of the European economic crises, of the brutalities committed against the Christian population of Egypt, or of the abduction and use of children as soldiers by a madman in Uganda. This is not even to mention the disquiet being experienced on the home front. Unemployment in the United States is still near its highest peak reached in 2008-09, and many are fed up with the current financial elite of our country, as well as with the lack of government involvement in controlling that sector of the economy (or with the overabundance of it, depending on who one asks). For the past decade, legislation being signed into law has increasingly been pushing us toward the prospect of a police state; away from liberty and toward security, conformity, and control. On both sides of the political fence, more and more of the people of this country are becoming disenchanted with the workings and decisions of our government. 



Clearly, something—many things—are wrong. We all know this. However, lest we prove to simply be malcontents, or cynics, or foolish youth who decry injustice without knowledge or solutions, we must seriously ask and discuss the questions: What ought we do about it? What can we do about it? But even more importantly, in order to come to a helpful, fruitful answer to this first question, we must ask a question that has even more primacy: Precisely what is wrong? As we have said, clearly something is wrong with our world, but what is it? Our answer to this question will determine the possibilities for our answer to the question regarding a solution. 





There are certainly quite a few possible options being proffered as answers. Everyone seems to have a pretty good idea of whom or what to blame for all our problems, but no one can seem to agree. Most often, which answer you will hear depends upon the affiliations of the person to whom the question is posed. Republicans blame Obama. Democrats blame Bush. Socialists blame the lack of state control in the financial sector, in healthcare, and in job creation. Libertarians blame government involvement for nearly everything. The poor blame the rich, and the rich don’t really care because they’re filthy rich. Everyone not occupying public office blames someone that is occupying public office, and those occupying public office redirect that blame on some other person or group in office. Political discourse has taken on the form of variations on a theme: it’s someone else’s fault. 





We all operate under the assumption that if everyone just listened to me, lived in accordance with the policies or party lines to which I ascribe, and finally stopped listening to that other idiot, the world would be a much better place. But deep down, we know that’s not true, don’t we? History has proved to us that, though empires rise and fall, systems of government change, and kings and czars have been  exchanged for presidents and prime ministers, animosity between people has mostly stayed the same. War has remained a constant force in human existence throughout more recent years, despite our having become “more civilized.” The presence of war has become even stronger in our more enlightened world. In the past century alone, tens of millions of people have been slaughtered to satisfy our thirst for wealth and power.[^1]   Our entire system of government is built upon the idea that the infringement upon our personal space by our neighbors is one of the greatest evils—thus we have a Bill of Rights designed to allow us to keep the neighbor at bay, should we desire to do so. Many of us do just this. How many of the friendships we still keep in “the real world” go anywhere beyond our favorite sports teams or bands? How many of the ties between us remain once we’ve stripped away our favorite movies or television shows? How many people know who we are apart from what is listed on our Facebook profiles?[^2]  How many of us keep the world and everyone in it at arm’s length, and fill our lives with enough stuff to convince us that we are content, fulfilled, happy? 



It is for these reasons that these times are both increasingly strange and increasingly estranged. If we are not careful, we can easily find ourselves becoming abstracted, living less and less in reality, and more and more in virtual reality. There is no distance on the internet. Even now, I am connected with hundreds of people, many of whom do not inhabit even the same continent as I am. While this can be a great good, we must take care lest we become so abstracted that it is difficult for us to conceive our own local environments as the places we actually inhabit, full of the people with whom we actually interact. While it is true that we ought to care for our fellow human beings throughout the world, the sad irony about this abstraction is that if we are unable to properly relate to the places in which we actually live and to the people we actually see daily, how can we truly care about those places and people we’ve never seen, whose names we’ve never heard, and whose pains we’ve never experienced?[^3]  It’s easy to be an advocate for change when all that is required of us is signing an online petition, when it requires no more personal sacrifice than the time it takes me to click my mouse. It’s easy to claim that the government ought to devote more resources to this or that social program, or the rich more resources to philanthropy. But what about when I see a homeless man begging for money at the side of the freeway off-ramp? What about when I find the man next door has suffered a debilitating injury, leaving him, his wife, and his children without the means to pay their bills? What about when I clearly have the ability to care for my neighbor, and yet I do nothing? Do not my protests then appear to be empty words? Our tolerance for others generally does not approach actual compassion.[^4]       





More and more the evidence suggests that, when we speak of social ills and their solutions, it is not our government, or the rich, or some other ruling elite with whom we ought to be concerned, but ourselves. But blaming the system allows us more easily ignore the disconnect between our spoken wishes for a better world for humanity and our day-to-day behavior, which unfortunately so often suggests that we actually care nothing for our fellow man. We speak of our tolerance of and love for Mankind at large, but find our next-door neighbor with the loud dogs intolerable, and constantly foster resentment toward that inconsiderate jerk. Our social media profiles are constantly updated with the information we believe will advertise us as the people we wish to resemble,[^5]  but we are mostly unwilling to look within ourselves to see if anything inside goes deeper than MTV, more substantive than Twilight, or more wholesome than McDonalds. We claim that the greed of corporate industry is reprehensible and condemn the self-interest they display, saying nothing about the systematic manner in which we act for the good of ourselves over the good of others. We complain about the injustices suffered by those in third-world countries and the lack of government aid for these people, but when that late night commercial for World Vision6  comes on, we immediately change the channel for fear that we’d find not our wallets *but our hearts empty*, devoid of empathy for the starving child we’d see on our television screens. We speak as though, if a good, all-powerful God did actually exist, *He would act*, and evil would be eradicated, but we are conveniently silent on our own ontological relationship to the Problem of Evil. Perhaps we are afraid our actions (or lack thereof) will prove we don’t exist.  



In any case, what is it we hope to accomplish in our political action—our voting, our protests?[^7]:  Perhaps it is true that the system is screwed up, that bankers run the world, that politicians are corrupt, and that (insert your least favorite political inclination here) is running our country into the ground. How in the world is simply being pissed off about it going to help the situation? How is voting for the other guy going to change things for the better, when so many of our politicians have proven they are untrustworthy by their voting records?[^8] How is shouting disgust from the rooftops going to “increase awareness” when *everyone already knows things are bad*? The only hope we have of success in such social endeavors hinges upon persuading those in power, whether political or economic, to give up the affluence afforded to them by that power, based solely on the vague appeal to a morality that we’ve beensocially and metaphysically undermining for the past several centuries.[^9] The chances of such action achieving its desired effects are slim at best, and we would be insane to trust in that alone. Besides, as we know again from history, even if by some miracle we succeeded in changing the system, it would prove to be of little value in the long run. Corrupt people beget corruption, and a system of government or control cannot change that fact. At best, a system, or lack thereof—be it social, political, economic, or otherwise—can only limit the effectual spread of the actions of corrupt people. Unless we would prefer a system that *prohibits action altogether*,[^10] it would only be a matter of time before we started seeing the same sorts of problems popping up once again.  



On the other hand, I do have the ability to change myself. I have been given the power to become good, regardless of what laws or policies or brutalities are enforced upon or against me. I can care for my neighbors. I have the ability to help the elderly, or sit with a grieving widow. I am able to comfort a struggling friend, or feed a homeless man or woman. I can choose to seek the good of others over my own. I can choose to treat those who offend me or persecute me with respect and compassion, even in the face of ridicule, or violence, or even death.[^11] I have it within my power to repay evil with good, no matter what is inflicted upon me. 





So why don’t I? 





Whatever the case may be, whether we shrug off our responsibility to practice virtue and compassion because of laziness or cowardice, or simply through ignorance or negligence, we must remedy this problem. We must become good. It is clear that, though the system may be flawed and our leaders may be corrupt, no systemic change we can make will have lasting effect unless we first become good enough to sustain it ourselves. We speak of social change, of activism, of revolution, not realizing that, without the most fundamental revolution—the revolution in the human heart, the revolt against banality, vice, and malice within ourselves—our so-called “social action” will ultimately result in the same old corruption, rehashed in a million different ways.  



It is for these reasons that, in response to the question, “What is biggest thing wrong with the world?” we must respond: “I am.”[^12]  




Think about it. You know it’s true. You are the problem, as am I. Our complaining is really only our stopgap; it’s the transference of the guilt we all feel, whether consciously or subconsciously, for the fact that we regularly treat people as objects to be used, that we treat the world as our own personal fiefdom, and that we act as though reality exists solely to provide us with the maximum amount of pleasure possible. You are selfish, I am selfish, and the world suffers because of it. 



We can choose to continue to ignore these things. We can choose to continue to believe that the system is the primary problem, or that only our leaders are responsible for how screwed up the world is. It certainly is easier upon ourselves to behave in this way. But this kind of thinking and acting simply ignores the facts of the matter: I am responsible for the world not being better than it currently is, even if in a small way, and the only person I have the ability to change is myself. The only conclusion to come to is that, if I want the world to be better, *I first must become good myself*. I must stop living for myself—die to myself—and begin living for others. Most of us don’t realize how truly revolutionary and deeply powerful this lifestyle is. In this broken world full of broken people, where everyone can (and mostly does) repay evil for evil, where everyone lives primarily in self-service, this is the *only truly subversive way of life.* We do not claim that this idea is new. Most of us have heard the maxim commonly attributed to Gandhi: “Be the change you want to see in the world.” This idea has also been at the center of the Christian religion since its beginnings—nearly two hundred years before Gandhi, the Russian saint Seraphim of Sarov summed it up this way: “Acquire the Spirit of peace, and thousands around you will be saved.” But how many of us truly take this idea to heart? How many of us systematically live our lives in this manner? How many of us make what is good completely our own— that is to say, how many of us completely own—*become*—the good?  





This *must* become our first and foremost goal. Whatever social action we choose to take, revolutionary or not, must be preceded by, borne out of, and subservient to this primary task. Only in this way will we have any lasting, truly good impact on our society and on our world, not only because the changes we make will be good, but because the changes we make will have not been imposed on us from without— they will have been born from within us.  



What we need, therefore, is *not* more legislation or different people in political office. What we need is a generation of people who cannot be bought by evil, no matter how sexy or innocent its packaging appears; a generation of people who cannot be deceived into believing lies, no matter who is telling them or how pleasing they are to our ears; a generation who refuses to pass the blame or treat people and reality as though they exist to serve their own self-interest. What we need is a generation full of people who are uncompromisingly ready to die to themselves and lay down their lives in service of others.  





Let the reader beware, however, for as we have said, while this road to change is far more sustainable and has the potential for far greater things, it is also much more difficult. It will require that we daily— *constantly*—lay down our very lives in service of others. It will require that we repay every evil, malice, and offense visited upon us with good, with genuine compassion and deference to our neighbor. This revolution of radical self-sacrifice may cost us much, should we truly embrace it, but we find that in   laying down ourselves for the sake of others, *dying to ourselves,* forgetting ourselves in the search for Goodness, Truth, and Beauty, we find what it means to truly be alive.  





We are The Humdrum Rebellion. Our rebellion is not glamorous, glorious, flashy, fun, or otherwise appealing to our overly consumerist ways of thinking, and it requires nothing less from us than our very lives. We make no demands, except to ourselves. We blame no one more than ourselves for how screwed up the world is. We call for no violence, except toward everything that is less than good and sacred within us. We seek to be the heralds of truth and compassion, champions of virtue and selfsacrifice, and though we may falter and fall short in this lofty endeavor time and time again, we will never stop fighting this battle.  





We are The Humdrum Rebellion. The challenge we issue is this: in an age where society has lost its sense of the beautiful, where what is fashionable is dictated by the corporate exploitation of desire, where individualism and self-serving behavior run rampant, and where the “freedom to choose” has created us to be slaves blown to and fro by the ever-changing winds of passion—do you dare rebel against yourself?  



We are The Humdrum Rebellion. 

We are the vanguard of the unseen resistance of the human heart. Join us. 

-The Humdrum Rebellion, February 2012 AD

[^1]: The most obvious offenders include Nazi Germany (6 million Jews killed, and hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians on both sides in their quest for the global “Aryan” state) and the self-genocide committed by the Soviet Russian regime (conservative estimates put the number of Russians slaughtered at forty [40] million, mostly under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, in the attempt to squelch anti-Communist [meaning “Christian”] behaviors), not to mention the millions killed by Pol Pot in Cambodia, the unknown number of Koreans killed by the North Korean Communist regime, or the thousands killed throughout the Middle East in recent years. Our enlightened sentiment of tolerance unfortunately has yet to catch up to our ability to wage destruction.   [^12] G. K. Chesterton’s (in)famous reply to a similar prompt from a London newspaper, and the subject of his subsequent essay explaining said reply. 


[^2]: The interesting irony about the internet is that while it allows us to share information to an extent never before seen, it allows us to control exactly what others see of us, as well as how much (or how little) of ourselves we share with our communities, thus creating a barrier to true communion between ourselves and others (an interesting article describing this process: http://gizmodo.com/5867268/facebook-is-making-us-miserable). 

[^3]:  St. John the Apostle makes a similar statement: “If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?” (1 John 4:20 KJV, emphasis added). The intuition driving both of these statements implies that a certain locality—an intimate experience of proximity—is required to truly love something or someone; it requires us to be personally present at some point with the object of our love. 

[^4]: One might argue that our modern tolerance actually has very little to do with compassion at all, as the ancient Christian virtue of tolerance did. It appears more likely that modern version of tolerance has much more to do with the rapid and viral dissemination of information now possible in our world—no one wants to be caught looking like a jerk. This is why racist, sexist, religious, and otherwise offensive jokes are still very much a part of our vocabulary, even in the Age of Tolerance, provided they are preceded by the now-customary glance over one’s shoulder. 


[^5]:  A simple, but fairly universal example of this type of personal PR might be the amount of pictures in which we *untag* ourselves. 

[^6]:  You know the one. The one narrated by the man with the silky, disarming voice who might be mistaken for Santa Claus. He pleads with you for an amount of money that resembles a fraction of the amount we spend on our daily Starbucks each month so the emaciated little girl standing next to him can eat. 

[^7]:  The unfortunate situation of the Occupy movements prompts us to ask these questions. Aside from the obvious hypocrisy of those who participate in the movement against corporate greed while drinking Starbucks and wearing Abercrombie clothing, there are far more serious problems that face the protesters. First off, because they have opted to remain anonymous and leaderless, they find themselves without a voice that can speak authoritatively for the movement. Since this is the case, the media (which is far faster and much more pervasive than the movement could ever hope to be) can make them say or look like anything they wish, as they are already doing. Secondly, if, as they claim, Washington is controlled largely by the interests of the financial sector, there is nothing to stop the bankers from enacting legislation that, while appearing to satisfy the “demands” of the movement, allows the financial sector to go about mostly business as usual. For a truly brilliant analysis of the predetermined failure of the movement, see the blog The Last Psychiatrist, “You are the 98" (http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/10/you_are_the_98.html#more). 

[^8]:  In fact, the claim that bankers and politicians are corrupt, coupled with the expectation we have that some other bankers and politicians are going to correct the problem seems to border on insanity. 


[^9]:  As Nietzsche so aptly demonstrated to us, the Enlightenment project to provide us with a rational, common morality unhindered by a religiously influenced metaphysics is an exercise in futility. Truly, in these modern times, the divide between master and slave moralities is growing sharper and deeper all the time. 

[^10]: Though, even this eventuality is much closer than we realize. Already in much of the West, the lines between dissenting behavior and sabotage (even of the non-violent variety) and terrorism are being blurred, and acts of socio-economic nonconformity are starting to be redefined as being “pre-terrorist” in nature. The case of the Tarnac Nine (France) is one of the most poignant examples of this change in political discourse (see http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/28/human-rights-tarnac-nine). Domestically, the Occupy movements have proven to be an enlightening litmus test of both of the police and the public’s changing responses to dissenting behavior. Even peaceful protest is met with surprisingly strong measures of pacification, and there is a growing amount of people in this country who believe that this type of response is completely warranted by this behavior. This is not even to mention the changes in official U.S. policy in recent years that has been marginalizing and even criminalizing dissention, giving the government broad authority to seek out and eliminate individuals deemed to be enemies of the state, most notably in the Patriot Act of 2001. At the time this introduction was written, legislation was being pushed through the Senate and signed into law by President Barack Obama that would enable (and in some cases require) the U.S. military to indefinitely detain anyone (including U.S. citizens) anywhere in the world (including within the United States) without charge or trial, upon order from the President (National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, S. 1867, Sec. 1021 and 1022). 

[^11]: Don’t believe me? There are numerous examples from history (even recent history) of people who do this very thing. Get off Twitter and read a book.
