<a target="_blank" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/philosophers-dont-get-much-respect-but-their-earnings-dont-suck/"> It's true. </a> Philosophy majors do well in today's job market. 

[Studying philosophy is very good idea](/philosophy-3-major) -- not only for your career and life goals. It's a good idea because it allows you to explore answers to some of life's deepest questions and have a lot of fun doing it.

Most college students will take exactly *one* philosophy class. [You should make the most of it.](/philosophy) 

If you do take a class, you might find it surprisingly good -- depending on the professor, of course. (A bad professor could make *Disneyland* boring.) 

Why is philosophy interesting? Perhaps because it invites you to think deeply about your life and your world, about reality, death, meaning, science, religion, and beauty. Everyone has opinions. Philosophy invites you to reflect, learn from others, and grow.
