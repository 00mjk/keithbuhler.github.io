Many people that take a philosophy class find it surprisingly interesting (depending on the professor, of course. A bad professor can make even film classes boring.) Everyone has opinions and questions about life, death, reality, science, religion, and beauty. 

Sadly, most college students will take exactly *one* philosophy class. [So you should make the most of it.](/philosophy-2-portal) The good news is that [studying philosophy is VERY GOOD IDEA](/philosophy-3-major) because it can help you to find a good job, earn a higher salary than a business degree, and find answers to life's deepest questions.
