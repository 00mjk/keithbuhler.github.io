Everyone has thoughts about life, death, reality, science, religion, and beauty. Most people that don't go to college will never study philosophy. 

Most people that go to college will take exactly *one* philosophy class. [So make the most of it.](/philosophy-2-portal)

<br>

### So, you're taking philosophy?

Most people that do take a class find philosophy surprisingly interesting (depending on the professor, of course. A bad professor can make even film classes boring.) 

A few of those will earn a major or minor. Should you? The short answer is: probably. [Studying philosophy is VERY GOOD IDEA.](/philosophy-major)
A major or minor will help you to find a good job, earn a higher salary than a business degree, become fully human, and find answers to life's deepest questions.
