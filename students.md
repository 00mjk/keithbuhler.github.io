Many still think philosophy is not worth your time.

It's true. [Studying philosophy is VERY GOOD IDEA](/philosophyportal/philosophy-3-major) because it can help you to find a good job, earn a higher salary than a business degree, and find answers to life's deepest questions.

Most college students will take exactly *one* philosophy class. [So you should make the most of it.](/philosophyportal) 

You'll probably find philosophy class surprisingly interesting... (depending on the professor, of course. A bad professor can make Disneyland boring.) 

Why is philosophy so interesting to so many? 

Perhaps because it invites you to think deeply. 

Everyone has opinions about the big questions of life: reality, death, meaning, science, religion, and beauty. Philosophy invites you to reflect on your own opinions and to learn from others.
