# Art

As a devout amateur, I am often creating. I encourage everyone to create, especially if they are not professionals. I encourage everyone to present their creations to family and friends, even if that is not "their thing."

I like to draw, paint, and sculpt. I also like to explore different media like pumpkins, snow, or Silly Putty. You can see some highlights below.

## Drawings

My friend [Bethany](https://www.freelanced.com/freelancers/portfolio/slides.aspx?freelancerid=120056&sampleid=296661) did an amazing painting inspired by a photograph I took of a fall day in Paso Robles, CA.
