**“…the greatest service we can do to education today is to teach fewer subjects.** ― C.S. Lewis, *Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life*


I have been teaching classically -- and learning -- since 2000. I've [taught](/teaching) Socratic seminars in a public school 4th grade GATE program, in three colleges, and high school.  My first class in 2001 was a 4th grade "Junior Great Books" class at a GATE program in a public school in Long Beach. 

This site is an ongoing compendium of essays and resources to guide you in teaching, and learning, classically. 

## What is classical education?

‘Classical education’ is shorthand for a cluster of related educational aims and methods. 

Classical education is not a radical innovation. It is not a social experiment. It is not indoctrination. It is not mere career training or college preparation. 

Rather, it is our oldest tradition that our culture has recently forgotten -- yet many around the world [are re-discovering.](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/geneveith/2013/06/classical-education-in-the-news/)

It is a set of comprise the best, time-tested practices for education -- the kind of education James Madison got at the college we now know at Princeton... the kind of education W. E. B. Dubois got at Harvard... the kind of education most Americans got in grammar school during the pre-Colonial era and the first 60 years after the Revolution. 

It is education to free the mind and make truly independent reasoners who are responsible adults and members of society. 

Classical education is simply truly liberal education. Its seven components are: 

1. **Read Great Books.** One clear mark of a classical school is a rich diet of “the Great Books” of western civilization. Homer’s *Iliad*, Virgil’s *Aeneid*, Dante’s *Divine Comedy*, Shakespeare’s *Tempest*, Newton’s *Principia*, Wollestencraft’s *Frankenstein*, Dosteyevsky's *Brothers Karamasov*, C. S. Lewis’ *Chronicles of Narnia*, Tolkein's *Lord of the Rings* are just a few of the timeless, illuminating, accessible and fascinating books from the Western canon through which students are introduced to the history, the priorities, the dynamic life of our culture. The heritage of the west is not just its books; it includes art, architecture, music, science, technology, theater, and film. Students who are reared on such a nutritious intellectual diet are not only much more fascinated by their studies, but often find their mind, heart, and habits shaped for a lifetime of learning in and out of the classroom. 
2. **Practice Socratic Discussion**. A second mark of a classical school is a commitment to discussion and dialogue. Modern social scientists discovered again and again that students retain up to five times more information learned through discussion than they do through lecture. Students become a part of the Great Conversation going on through the Great Books. They don’t just spectate, they participate in dialogues about God, investigations into the natural world, and explorations of what it means to be human — all in the context of a group of friends who are on the same quest. Guided by a lively facilitator committed to speaking the truth in love, students discard false beliefs and acquire new truths in an exhilarating and challenging discussion. 
3. **Learn Greek and Latin languages**. Part of the commitment to mastering English is mastering our source languages: mostly Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. 
4. **Follow the Trivium and Quadrivium:** Many classical educators follow a three-stage process. (This model has roots in the ancient world and was formalized by medieval educators to map onto normal child development stages.)  Students proceed through Grammar, Logic (or Dialectic), and Rhetoric as their curiosity and capability increase. Grammar (concepts), Logic (conceptual structures at rest), Rhetoric (conceptual structures in motion). As students advance, they learn the Quadrivium: Arithmetic (pure number), Geometry (number in space), Music (number in time), Astronomy (number in space and time).
5. **Learn the Master Skills.** All truly well-educated people read well, write well, think well, and live well. The master skills to think and live well are the "real" subject behind every discipline: language, logic, math, reading, conversing, and speaking. Educational experts sometimes call these meta-cognitive processes. They are thoughts that apply to other thoughts. The classical education movement is aiming to get ‘back to the basics.’ Students learn not only subjects, topics, facts — they learn how to learn. Even as some facts are forgotten or some subjects never used again, the master skills of thinking, reading, writing, and speaking lasts a lifetime. 
6. **Mentorship model of teaching**. The means are actually simple: Trained educators mentoring students, helping them learn how to learn. In this mentorship, classical educators often read and discuss [“Great Books”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_books), those beautiful and timeless texts that even when wrong delight and instruction. These powerful works naturally enliven student interest and profoundly impact the imagination, mind, and heart of any who pick them up. Engaging in careful discussion in small groups naturally teaches students the “meta skills” of learning how to learn and equips them for a life of continual growth. 
7. **Acquire Moral and Intellectual virtues.** Parents want their children to become thoughtful adults with character and integrity. [Employers want workers of good character who can think well.](http://www.aarpworksearch.org/Inside/Pages/HowEmployableAmI.aspx) Classical education, as it happens, specializes in just those two areas. The goal is not only to give students a standardized set of facts and abilities, but to form them into virtuous and thoughtful members of society, church, and family. 

Various schools and educators will emphasis one or more of these over the others; various schools and educators will add some components or subtract others. Classical education is not a strictly defined entity under the purview of a few experts. It is our common heritage. It is our common property. It belongs to us all. 

When teaching students to follow God and love goodness, truth, beauty, and justice, we ourselves seek to follow God and attain goodness, truth, beauty, and justice.

We don't have to do it perfectly. We just have to do our part to restore the [“Lost Tools of Learning”](http://www.gbt.org/text/sayers.html) to our generation.

## FAQ

FAQ

**1. Should I consider classical education for my family?** 
The short answer is, ‘Yes!’ Every American family should know their options, including home school, private school, charter school, and more. 

Veritas Academy combines the flexibility of home-school cooperative network with the rigor of a 2-day college preparatory model —  guided throughout by a commitment to classical education. 

**2. Is classical education for me?** 
Classical education is a wonderful option for many families. But even if you are already pursuing homeschooling in a Christian environment, you have options.  So you may be asking the practical question, “Is it for me?” and “Is it for my child?” 

This discernment process takes time and prayer. Every family ought to know first of all that the classical education movement exists. If you’re here, you know!

The next step then is to ask... What is it? And why do it? 




### What is the motive for classical education? 
The motive of many public education institutions is the production of productive members of society. The motive of classical schools is the formation of virtuous men and women. The Robert E. Lee was president of Washington College, he told his students, “We have no printed rules. We have but one rule here, and it is that every student must be a gentleman.” 

On this model, ethics is not one subject among many but a core of every subject. Like rationality itself, and the virtues of hard thinking, clear speech, a hatred of deception and falsehood, the ethical model expressed perfectly in Jesus Christ is the standard of all our behaviors and habits. 

We learn to read and write and speak, we become experts on this or that topic in this or that field not in order to puff ourselves up with knowledge, but to love God fully with our minds (and our whole selves) and to be equipped members of the Kingdom of God while sojourning in the city of man.
