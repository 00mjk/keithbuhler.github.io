**"The greatest service we can do to education today is to teach fewer subjects.** ― C.S. Lewis, *Surprised by Joy*


## Intro

This site is an ongoing compendium of essays and resources to guide you in teaching, and learning, classically. 

I have been teaching classically -- and learning -- since 2000.  My first class in 2001 was a 4th grade "Junior Great Books" class at a GATE program in a public school in Long Beach. I've [taught](/teaching) Socratic seminars in a public schools, private schools, home school academies, and three universites. 


## What is classical education?

‘Classical education’ is shorthand for a cluster of related educational aims and methods. 

Classical education is not a radical innovation. It is not a social experiment. It is not indoctrination. It is not mere career training or college preparation. 

Rather, it is our oldest tradition that our culture has recently forgotten -- yet many around the world [are re-discovering.](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/geneveith/2013/06/classical-education-in-the-news/)

It is a set of comprise the best, time-tested practices for education -- the kind of education James Madison got at the college we now know at Princeton... the kind of education W. E. B. Dubois got at Harvard... the kind of education most Americans got in grammar school during the pre-Colonial era and the first 60 years after the Revolution. 

It is education to free the mind and make truly independent reasoners who are responsible adults and members of society. 


## Three Components

### Great Books 

Number one is the "great books."" What we study is unique. You'll never study a textbook that was written by committee of secular eductators, or professional educators in on Capitol Hill who are trying to decide how to put everything politically correctly and feed it to the to the children in schools as young as possible. 

You may find textbooks written by classical educators like Martin Cothran or Christopher Perrin, but you'll also find books themselves. The Holy Bible; the Republic of Plato; the city of God by Augustine; we read not only modern classics like CS Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien's *the Hobbit*, but we read old books. The *Tao te Ching* which influence CS Lewis not a Christian book, but it's a good book. Not completely true, it's not inspired, but it's very worth reading. Beowulf, which influenced JR Tolkien, and so on.

What makes a great book great? This is a hard question. But here are a few reflections. 

Suppose there's a normal scale of quality from 1-100. Maybe someon recommends a book and it's a 60 or 80 out of 100. Maybe your favorite book of all time is in the 90s or 95s. 

The book we read in high school that you can't reread ever since that is a big 80 of 100. 

The great books are like anywhere between 99.95 and 99.99 in terms of the quality. 

The impact, the power, these are books that before the printing press people took the time to recopy and so we just read those.  Why not start there? There's nothing magical about old books; if you get the best books from the future we would take that!  The old books have taken time to be whittled out. It's like watching the 10 best TV shows of the last what, 60 years. 

How long is TV that around identity and TV  some shows preventing is TV in principle but there's so much crap on their every good show you Australian good episode. Mr. Wade through 100 there a waste of your time or detrimental. So what if in 500 years we could gather all the best shows from the 1950s to 2013 and maybe it's watch and maybe all the rest of it falls away and show that two people for entertainment for some instruction.

Also, because God wrote a Holy Book. If God made the Holy Movie maybe we’d study more films. Not just books, but Great Texts. Wherever goodness, truth, and beauty can be found, that’s we’re going to discuss. We do study a couple of films in the Inklings. 


### Great Conversation 

The second distinctive is discussion oriented education called Socratic discussion called it interactive classroom college dialogue. There's something consistently look at classical schools and even some charter schools are doing this now and small colleges naturally build their classrooms around discussion. This requires smaller class sizes, which is one of the limitations it only gets me students into a room with an educator, expect there to have it. Expect them to have a discussion, so why discussion, the research shows that whatever you teach me you remember. So if I'm teach new material I remember it you listening are you remember all discussions away of you teaching me students teach the teachers I commend the class of the question. I may or may not know the answer to if I don't know the answer then it's because I want to learn it I want the students to learn it with me. I do know the answer is because I want to see what the students think and test my own answer because they may have a better one. So when I asked the question the students begin teaching me is a great organization called philosophy for kids that's created a second grade curriculum of many great books really good picture books and stories and they have discussions with the second graders and you can see these eight-year-olds seven-year-olds is a six-year-old teaching the teacher about ethics because they get and really driving home points but I'm certain her last them for years to come if not the rest of your life and making arguments engaging in logical discourse. They may not have my philosophy grad student vocabulary but they have some of my philosophy grad student ideas and so when we take the great books put them in front of you and you read them and I read them and your parents read them. We cannot talk about. We're all dying to talk about. So when adjusted in the classroom in a more focused and disciplined way. Like I've spent 1000 hours learning how to lead a discussion and I'm still a beginner. It's disciplined and yet there's always something to learn and I'm always making basic mistakes in trying to correct myself and my ninth-grade students with cocaine say that discussion was no good and I'll say great why and I'll say we wasted too much time and I'll say you're right, all the better. How are you can help and we'll talk about it. It's a group project because it's careful it's disciplined or not your sharing our opinions. It's going somewhere and yet it's real life role coming to this book, trying to understand.

Socratic dialogue: Studies show that students retain 5 times more (50% instead of 10%) that they learn in an interactive environment. 
We come to know each other and ourselves in dialogue. We come to be friends, co-learners, for a lifetime. 

### Great Hearts
The third distinction is the motivation for education itself. 

Why do we do education if you have someone why they're going to school you realize the motivation has been lost. Why are you going to school so I can go to more school is basically answer why are you going to this high school so I can get into a good college but then why get into a good college psyching get a good job will I get a good job so I can have lots of money. Why have lots of money so I can afford to send my kids to a good school. This doesn't make sense and also if you're getting an education just to get a good job. There's 100 more efficient ways to do so right how many of you were working by the time you're 16 and it just turns out that's a better way to prepare for your job. Where were headed is character formation and it's not just character formation, its character transformation because Jesus Christ was a human being and he was God. Jesus Christ is fully divine and fully human, and we are called the walk in his footsteps. So to remain merely human is not her calling, but Paul as Paul says to grope the full stature to be sons of God to be united to Christ in our education. Yes at the kindergarten in the prekindergarten level at the high school level at the college level at the graduate school level at the level of working in your career and continuing education is about answering that calling. It's about not just learning some new fax but overcoming my sins overcoming my ignorance I God's grace and that starts with knowledge of ignorance that starts with repentance and so school and church and family work in harmony to produce the same goal parents what you want, except for a student, a child who grows up to be mature, loving, caring, compassionate, responsible in a word, a virtuous human being and what church are we therefore yes to pay God is due to worship God to follow God to obey God what is God tell us to do P holy as my father in heaven is holy or in Paul's words be like Christ as I am like Christ. And so in school were not detracting from that purpose. God forbid, were not training people to disbelieve the tenets of the faith were not training people to do whatever they want or not passing out tools that no high school student who's not married should touch in the name of education were advancing the calling that we've been given by God. The responsibility individually and corporately that we've been given to pursue his son and to become like his son and don't ask me how it happened but it it happens when we sit around a book of Plato and have a hard discussion, it happens. We sit around the gospel of John, and have a hard discussion is only one part of the People's part of the puzzle but it's an important part in it something that you can be a part of is your chill child reads virtual in Lawrenceville Roman history and as they learn how to learn which will take them on into adulthood and treat them well. 


## Seven Components

Classical education is simply truly liberal education. Its seven components are: 

1. **Read Great Books.** One clear mark of a classical school is a rich diet of “the Great Books” of western civilization. Homer’s *Iliad*, Virgil’s *Aeneid*, Dante’s *Divine Comedy*, Shakespeare’s *Tempest*, Newton’s *Principia*, Wollestencraft’s *Frankenstein*, Dosteyevsky's *Brothers Karamasov*, C. S. Lewis’ *Chronicles of Narnia*, Tolkein's *Lord of the Rings* are just a few of the timeless, illuminating, accessible and fascinating books from the Western canon through which students are introduced to the history, the priorities, the dynamic life of our culture. The heritage of the west is not just its books; it includes art, architecture, music, science, technology, theater, and film. Students who are reared on such a nutritious intellectual diet are not only much more fascinated by their studies, but often find their mind, heart, and habits shaped for a lifetime of learning in and out of the classroom. The Great Books teach *history* folded in to its curriculum from the earliest stage. 
3. **Learn Greek and Latin languages**. Part of the commitment to mastering English is mastering our source languages: mostly Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Most of the Great Books of the west were written in Latin or Greek. Until these works were translated, "students had to learn Latin and Greek for instrumental reasons" [(Martin Cothran)](https://youtu.be/dTi-R01HUIU?t=7m50s)
2. **Practice Socratic Discussion**. A second mark of a classical school is a commitment to discussion and dialogue. Modern social scientists discovered again and again that students retain up to five times more information learned through discussion than they do through lecture. Students become a part of the Great Conversation going on through the Great Books. They don’t just spectate, they participate in dialogues about God, investigations into the natural world, and explorations of what it means to be human — all in the context of a group of friends who are on the same quest. Guided by a lively facilitator committed to speaking the truth in love, students discard false beliefs and acquire new truths in an exhilarating and challenging discussion. 
7. **Acquire Moral and Intellectual virtues.** Parents want their children to become thoughtful adults with character and integrity. [Employers want workers of good character who can think well.](http://www.aarpworksearch.org/Inside/Pages/HowEmployableAmI.aspx) Classical education, as it happens, specializes in just those two areas. The goal is not only to give students a standardized set of facts and abilities, but to form them into virtuous and thoughtful members of society, church, and family. The motive of many public education institutions is the production of productive members of society. The motive of classical schools is the formation of virtuous men and women. The Robert E. Lee was president of Washington College, he told his students, “We have no printed rules. We have but one rule here, and it is that every student must be a gentleman.” On this model, ethics is not one subject among many but a core of every subject. Like rationality itself, and the virtues of hard thinking, clear speech, a hatred of deception and falsehood, the ethical model expressed perfectly in Jesus Christ is the standard of all our behaviors and habits. 
4. **Follow the Trivium and Quadrivium:** Many classical educators follow a three-stage process. This model has roots in the ancient world and was formalized by medieval educators to map onto normal child development stages.  Students proceed through Grammar, Logic (or Dialectic), and Rhetoric as their curiosity and capability increase. The grammar stage is a place of memorization. The logic stage is a stage of ratiocination. The rhetoric stage is the stage of creation. Grammar (concepts), Logic (conceptual structures at rest), Rhetoric (conceptual structures in motion). As students advance, they learn the Quadrivium: Arithmetic (pure number), Geometry (number in space), Music (number in time), Astronomy (number in space and time).
5. **Learn the Master Skills.** All truly well-educated people read well, write well, think well, and live well. The master skills to think and live well are the "real" subject behind every discipline: language, logic, math, reading, conversing, and speaking. Educational experts sometimes call these meta-cognitive processes. They are thoughts that apply to other thoughts. The classical education movement is aiming to get ‘back to the basics.’ Students learn not only subjects, topics, facts — they learn how to learn. Even as some facts are forgotten or some subjects never used again, the master skills of thinking, reading, writing, and speaking lasts a lifetime. We learn to read and write and speak, we become experts on this or that topic in this or that field not in order to puff ourselves up with knowledge, but to love God fully with our minds (and our whole selves) and to be equipped members of the Kingdom of God while sojourning in the city of man. 
6. **Mentorship model of teaching**. The means are actually simple: Trained educators mentoring students, helping them learn how to learn. In this mentorship, classical educators often read and discuss [“Great Books”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_books), those beautiful and timeless texts that even when wrong delight and instruction. These powerful works naturally enliven student interest and profoundly impact the imagination, mind, and heart of any who pick them up. Engaging in careful discussion in small groups naturally teaches students the “meta skills” of learning how to learn and equips them for a life of continual growth. 

Various schools and educators will emphasis one or more of these over the others; various schools and educators will add some components or subtract others. Classical education is not a strictly defined entity under the purview of a few experts. It is our common heritage. It is our common property. It belongs to us all. 

When teaching students to follow God and love goodness, truth, beauty, and justice, we ourselves seek to follow God and attain goodness, truth, beauty, and justice.

We don't have to do it perfectly. We just have to do our part to restore the [“Lost Tools of Learning”](http://www.gbt.org/text/sayers.html) to our generation.

## My story 

Have you ever noticed that God doesn’t give us a task because we’re worthy of it? He gives us a task because it needs to get done, and he gives us grace to do it. Parenting is like this. We're not up for the task, but it needs to be done. Education is like this. Classical education is simply a commitment to do what has worked in our own time. In that sense, "Classical education" is a diverse set of best practices. 

Classical education, in my experience, has three distinctives: Great Books, Great Conversation, Great Hearts. What we learn is different; how we learn is different; and *why* we learn is different. 

In my experience classical education has three main distinctives. I was homeschooled myself through most of my pre-college education. 

I went to high school but I left early. (Students don’t tell your parents that your teacher dropped out of high school!)

The high school counselor, God bless him, asked me what I wanted in a college and all I knew was that I did not want high school part two. 

I always loved reading because my mom taught me to read. She put lots of books in the house and I was always reading. 

## Torrey Honors Program. 

What experiences not just some good books. What experiences a whole person transformation. It was an emotional shift the spiritual shift and intellectual shift a social shift in my life and new friends with whom I could talk about new ideas in a sense I was estranged from my family Intel I could find the words to explain what was going on inside of me. They had no idea and I was falling in love, not just with books. 

But with truths and realities perhaps most importantly, I was coming to learn what Christians believe and why and how I fell short, we often say a good thing to do is to learn what you believe and why. And that's true so far as it goes, but I didn't really believe it, but I didn't even know. I didn't really believe it and I didn't know why it's not that I had tried Christianity and it was found wanting. It said it was found difficult and I didn't even try. 

Now I was exposed to the best secular thinking the best pagan thinking, yes even the best anti-Christian thinking Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Marx Immanuel Kant and I was able to see for the first time that the Christian view of truth. In fact, Christ himself. Christ's worldview, if you will wins in the market of ideas and to see how unique the Christian view. Actually it's we're not making this stuff up smart Christians of either discovered these truths the best interpretation of of God and man in the universe. The past the present and the future or got himself a stepped in and said let dice you not getting it but me explain how the creation happened and we take this and we try to understand it. And we deepen it. We take the revelation we received and this is the truth and within the Christian community across all time up to the present moment and continuing on in the next generation. There's a fence outside which we know that there's error and sin and falsehood, and within which there some room to play. There's ideas we can banter about on the philosopher so like analyzing concepts all the concepts that I analyze are all that important so that some of its cow like doing a puzzle in some of its dangerous some of its I might have to take a class in a graduate program and analyze really, really wicked ideas like suppose there is no morality I guess that could be true but it's dangerous to think about the dangers to consider it and yet professionally and personally I'm interested in looking at that and coming to the answer, yes there is morality and this can be argued both from science, see Richard Dawkins. Thank you, delete that from philosophy see Thomas Aquinas and Descartes and even Plato himself and from theology in so it classical education context. My education became real life. It wasn't books go to school and learn some lessons and then go out into the big world and and see what life's really all about. It was let's bring real life into school and begin to practice on some of these big ideas. These dangerous ideas, these life-saving ideas. These truths from wherever they come and save my faith and so I think that Christianity is true. Yes because my parents taught me. And also because I looked into it and also because it makes you a good person and also because people that I trust in the past testify to it and also because those who are not Christians are either not Christians for bad reasons, though Christians are hypocritical when you're not look where all hypocritical the question is what's the right standard to hold to or because they're it never looked into it they never looked into both sides. 



CS Lewis, who was shipped off to boarding school is a nice young British boy when he was about 12 years old and from Ireland to England and met his tutor to his dad always said was a really nice fellow good friend who turned out to be an ironfisted ruler of education and speeds books before Lewis was a Christian, he converted much later in life under the influence of his friend you are talking among others by learning Greek books and Latin books by reading Homer and audit and Virgil, a young age the world opened up to him the best art the best architecture the best science the best music and in that air. One can only be a non-Christian for so long and as one who is passionate about the truth and who had the honor to follow the argument wherever it led into stick to his own promises. He eventually found they found the Anglican Christian expression that was so out of fashion in his time and Jack as he was known to his friends. Dr. Lewis Prof. Lewis started swimming against the stream and he got nothing for it. He lost friends he lost jobs. He was insulted. He was ill reputed in his little college and he wrote a few books that have been made into movies called the Chronicles of Narnia and the first three or four films so far have grossed $1 billion all over the world to this man's intellect which was so passionately Christian, so powerfully intelligent these persuaded thousands to the faith driving them back to the Bible, back to the son of God the gamut that ironfisted educator in England foreseeable learn history paradigms against his will so hold out hope. There's a lot to this were not perfect, but we see what we could have ever going for it

## Conclusion

So as we all pursue her continuing education if the kingdom. May help us to become better students, better disciples,  better Christians in the service of his gospel, for of all his people Christian or non-Christian, until we come to see the good, the true the beautiful itself, Jesus Christ our Lord.

## FAQ

**1. Should I consider classical education for my family?** 
The short answer is, ‘Yes!’ Every American family should know their options, including home school, private school, charter school, and more. 

Veritas Academy combines the flexibility of home-school cooperative network with the rigor of a 2-day college preparatory model —  guided throughout by a commitment to classical education. 

**2. Is classical education for me?** 
Classical education is a wonderful option for many families. But even if you are already pursuing homeschooling in a Christian environment, you have options.  So you may be asking the practical question, “Is it for me?” and “Is it for my child?” 

This discernment process takes time and prayer. Every family ought to know first of all that the classical education movement exists. If you’re here, you know!The next step then is to ask... What is it? And why do it?
