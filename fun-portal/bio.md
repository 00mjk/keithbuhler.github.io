Thanks for reading. My quest in life is to become wise. I want to expose all rational and moral errors in myself by reflecting on my life and on the best the human race has to offer. Then I want to expose any such errors in my enemies and in my friends. 

I'm the youngest of seven kids, born and raised in [greater Los Angeles area.](https://screen.yahoo.com/californians-drama-off-405-000000032.html) I was home-schooled for many years before entering college early. 

The Torrey Honors Institute at Biola University exposed me to the "great books" of western tradition. There I acquired a broad base in Humanities, philosophy, art,  psychology, and Biblical studies. I am grateful for my time there in which I was invited to read philosophy, literature, history, theology, poetry, science, and more. I learned most most studying Plato with John Mark Reynolds and with Al Geier of Rochester University ([Zeus in human form](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=190830)). Geier's method of dialectical exercise most of all has formed my pedagogy in my own classes. I also earned a minor in Biblical Studies. 

After college, I worked in real estated but read voraciously, especially ancient and medieval philosophy (Plato, Plotinus, Proclus, Aquinas, Maimonides). Eventually I took some M.A. courses in philosophy and theology. I took metaphysics and philosophy of mind with [J. P. Moreland](http://www.jpmoreland.com/) at Talbot Graduate School. During this time, I became disgruntled with metaphysical naturalism, which is sadly a common prejudice in analytic philosophers. Shortly after joining the Orthodox Christian Church, I earned an [M. A. in Applied Orthodox Theology](http://www.antiochian.org/studies/st-stephens-ma-program) from the University of Balamand.   

I worked as a high school teacher for five years (2007-2012) and became Master Tutor. After marrying Lindsay, we decided it was time to get a [PhD](http://keithbuhler.github.io/fun/phd). We moved to Kentucky in 2012, so it's my first time out of the country. We had a baby the same week school started. Things have been less crazy since. 

My academic [research](/research) centers on contemporary analytic virtue ethics. I am currently "ABD" at the University of Kentucky. My current advisor, David Bradshaw, works "on the ways that ancient Greek philosophy shaped medieval philosophy and religious thought, and how these, in turn, contributed to the formation of modernity." 


A historical, traditional approach made an indelible mark on my approach to philosophical issues. So my bias is toward "classics" like Plato's *Republic*, the *Tao Te Ching*, and Aquinas *Summa Theologica*.  Of course, I also admire many contemporary philosophers: Thomas Nagel, Alasdair MacIntyre, Rosalind Hursthouse, Richard Swinburne, JP Moreland, Alan Gibbard, John McDowell, John Haldane, and Hilary Putnam, and many others. 

In the mean time, my non-philosophical interests include [clay sculpture](/art), YouTubing, and [composing lists of non-philosophical interests.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)
