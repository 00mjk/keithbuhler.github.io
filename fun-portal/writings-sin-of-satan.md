# The Sin of Satan

by Keith Buhler

## Introduction:

The problem of evil is the hardest problem for theists to solve. It is the best rational reason not to believe in the Christian God, the father of Jesus Christ. It is “the one serious objection to the existence of God.” (Kreeft, “The Problem of Evil”).

Of course, the problem of goodness is, I think, the hardest problem for nontheists to solve. If we are born for no reason amid a long and varied flux of particles in a space-time void that arose for no reason and will eventually cool down (or heat up) and die for no reason, then why should there be such creatures (as ourselves) as long for meaning, love goodness for its own sake, not just survive but value survival, and hate injustice? The problem of goodness is not an answer to the problem of evil. But it does level the playing field a bit and settle a fairly heavy burden of proof on both parties.

All that aside, many philosophers of religion have tackled evil, both to explain it in more detail, and to solve it or to explain it away. But few have attended to a second question about angelic evil (or demonic evil). The problem of evil is sometimes divided into moral (human) evil, including the cruelty we inflict on others and the meaningless suffering we endure, and natural evil, including the apparently needless suffering of animals and the occurence of disasters like earthquakes, hurricaines, asteroid collisions, and (the eventual) heat death of the universe.

Death by itself, the fact of death, human and nonhuman death, is perhaps the shortest and fullest summation of evil. If no babies ever died, and if natural disasters never killed any living thing, then perhaps not even the problem of pain would be much trouble.

But spiritual evil has been neglected, at least in contemporary conversations. For one, hell is a greater evil even than pain or death, since the traditional understanding of hell is a place where suffering does not stop. The suffering of humans in hell, unlike the suffering in life, cannot in principle be redeemed by the eventual gift of eternal life face to face with God. Some have tried to solve this by denying the traditional understanding of hell; others by explaining the suffering in hell in a way consonat with God's justice and goodness and human happiness, even though some of those we love remain in hell. But my purpose here is not to discuss hell, at least not directly.

The second spiritual evil is angelic evil. The fall of Satan is the most bewildering, most confusing, and most pernicious evil that ever happened in the history of creation. Or perhaps it is second only to the betrayal of Judas Iscariot. Both Satan and Judas saw God face to face, but Judas saw Jesus in the flesh, worked with him, performed miracles in his name, took bread with him, and still betrayed him for no greater cause than love of money. Satan saw God directly, spiritually, and, presumably, betrayed him. He did not betray him for money. Why did he, then? The Holy Scriptures give two clues: envy, and pride. But giving a full and detailed account of just how pride and/or envy caused a purely good spiritual creature to reject a purely good spiritual creator is, to my mind, the most interesting piece of the problem of evil. All the more so because so little has been written about it thus far.

To believers, we say that the explanation of evil lies in humanity (and humanity's freedom), then the next question is obviously why we exercised our freedom poorly. The answer to that is that Satan tempted Eve and Adam. So the follow up question is why did Satan tempt them? Why did he become a tempter, an accuser? To nonbelievers, Satan is, as a literary character, of great interest and importance. Of course, I think Satan is real. But he is also a character, as Judas Iscarito is both a real historical figure and a literary character (so is Christopher Columbus, Ronald Ragan, Michelangelo, etc.). But as a character at least he is, according to Christians (and to Christ, for what it's worth) the author of evil even before man. So the problem of evil (if you wish to criticize specifically the notion of and belief in the Christian God) is much deeper than human free will.

Furthermore, if the Christian God is at least possibly real, then Satan stands to him in starkest contrast. The devil is not a "rival god" (for the devil too is created) but he departed most fully from God's design. As Christians understand the situation, Satan represents one of two choices every rational agent can take: for or against God. We can be Satan or Michael; Peter or Judas. There is no middle way. To stand against the Christian God is to stand with the one whom Christians call Satan. 

When historical Christians have called unbelievers (or worse yet, heretics) the "spawn of Satan" this was not merely an insult. It was an attempt at an accurate description. Even Jesus used the phrase, describing certain religious believers as sons of Satan, meaning that they took Satan as their guide, their leader, their progenitor (John 8:44).

If this were true, it would be a very important truth to know. Thankfully, Jesus let some religious people know they were sons of Satan. They presumably wished to be sons of God in the house of God but were sons of satan in the house of Satan. Now, even though they were the sons of Satan, they had the opportunity to run away from home. Though they were in Satan's "family," they had the option of estrangement, abdication, adoption. But before such a momentous decision can be made they had to know where they stood. So likewise with you. If you reject the Christian notion of God, if you find the concept of God incoherent or the character of that God reprehensible or the people of God radically mistaken in their ethics, beliefs, politics, and way of life, then you ought to know where (from their perspective at least) you stand. Some indeed have recognized this and allied with Satan as a literary character at least. [Philip Zimbardo](http://www.lucifereffect.com/about_synopsis.htm) is a recent example, but there are others. So, to both believers (Christian or otherwise) and nonbeleivers, I offer this dialogue to introduce, recapitulate, and hopefully progress the conversation. May God grant us mercy.

I offer my preliminary reflections on the sin of Satan below. Unfortunately, these reflection do not amount to an answer. They do not even aim to quell the anger of an atheist who demands that God explain (in person) his actions, or that the devil explain (in person) why he chose to rebel. Rather, these reflections are for believers who believe and also want to understand. To get some likely guesses is the best we can hope for in response to some questions. Or they are for non-believers who do not believe but genuinely want to understand.

However tentative, these reflections contribute, I hope, to a conversation of interest to both believers and non-believers.

## The Sin of Satan, a Dialogue ##

*Setting: Zach and Lucy, brother and sister, are reading on a Sunday summer afternoon.*


Zach: Look it up, O Light One.

Lucy: Why, O Lame One?

Z: I'm trying to read.

L: But Zach, I want to know whether God the Father is humble.

I think so... but just look it up.

I don't think so... and I can't find it anywhere in the Bible or on Christian Classics Ethereal Library.

Well, you must not be looking hard enough. I am thinking about something else so I can't engage in our usual lengthy dialectisizing.

I'd rather talk than read. What are you reading about?

The fall of Adam. It doesn't make sense.

How so?

Here we go. I guess I'll close my book.

That's fine with me. If I discuss your question, then you'll have to discuss mine.

We'll see about that. So, first, all evil originates either from God (the uncreated) or from some creature, right?

Of course.

And if God is all good and all powerful, then he can't have created evil.

Why not?

Because as all good he would not want to create or permit it, and as all powerful he would not create it nor fail to permit it.

I see.

And God is all good, as he reveals himself to the Psalmist, to Moses, to the Prophets, and especially in our Lord. He is blameless and without sin, even according to our merely "human" standards of sin. Jesus at least, is humble and meek as a lamb. God puts up with injustice for the sake of love. He created to share his joy with creatures and he redeems out of compassion.

Beautifully said.

So evil must have originated from some creature, yes?

That is, if evil exists.

But clearly evil exists. War is evil, at least, most wars, most of the time. Everyone you meet has personal vices, addictions to sugar, tobacco, wine and liqour, sex, money, fame, applause, power, back-biting, promise-breaking, and many more. We can't stop. Crime is a fact of human society and the denser the city the denser the crime. The history of mankind is a history written in blood. We are virtually destroying the planet with our wasteful consumption and disregard. We have no idea what is good for us, and every nation, and every faction within each nation, is pursuing some different and opposing aim or the same aim with different and opposing means. Even when we achieve some aim we spoil it by gloating or by immediately losing sight of the virtues we used to achieve it. Those who did not achieve their aim envy the successful and hate them for their success. It doesn't much matter who gets their aim and who doesn't, because cancer, heart disease, some fluke accident, or if nothing else old age will claim our lives in the end. Overall, we are a restless, bored, suicidal, back-biting, delusional, and death-bound collection of empty selves. How could anyone deny the existence of evil?

My friend, I am not saying there is no such thing as evil -- just that it is not an existing thing. It is a corruption, or perversion, or privation of good things. The good things exist, and they are indeed corrupted, but the corruption is not a thing along with other things. A stick is a thing, and straightness is its property. When the stick is bent, "bentness" is not a new "thing" that comes into being. Rather, a bent stick has lost its straightness. Likewise, humanity is a thing, and you and I are things (or people), with goodness, mind, heart, aims, goals, abilities, capacities, language, and love. But when these are "bent" then we become evil, and all of the social and personal evils you mention come to pass.

I see better what you mean, Lucifer, about evil "not existing"... but still, it doesn't explain where evil came from.

Yes it does! Man is free, he has a free will, and so that can go wrong. The natural elements of man (his blood circulation, his respiration, his growth and aging) are governed by laws outside his control and therefore can't go wrong. The supernatural elements (his mind, heart, will, and so on) are governed partly by heteronomous laws and partly by his own autonomous laws. We not only set laws for our own behavior that are different from God's laws, thus breaking his laws, but we also break our own laws. We have corrupted ourselves.

But does all evil stem from man's corrupt will?

Yes, where else?

What about natural evil, the flood of Katrina, the psunami's of Thailand, the tornados of Kansas. Surely man's will did not corrupt the weather?

The flood of Noah was caused by man...

Yes but that was a special case. Do you think every natural disaster is caused by man's wickedness, or rather, by God punishing man's wickedness?

No, not every one. At least, for many natural disasters it is not clear how or why God would have caused it. Like when a tornado occurs out in the middle of a plain and only one or a few people are hurt because they happen to be driving through. Suppose those people were God-fearing Christians. Was that tornado caused by God who knew they would be driving through, and they deserved some punishment? Or was the tornado going to happen because of the weather, and they decided to drive through, and it was a wrong-time, wrong-place kind of moment.

Exactly. So why are there natural disasters? Why did God create a world such that some events are hazardous for us?

Perhaps God made man a sort of microcosm. In man both angelic intellegience and material animality unite. So when man falls, he not only brings spiritual evil but physical corruption. His corrupting his will was like the grain of sand in the gears of an intricate clock. Man is part of that clock, one of the gears, but also outside of the clock governing it. When he failed to do his job, he caused a chain reaction through the whole clock (the rest of the physical cosmos).

That's really interesting. So tornados happen because Adam and Eve ate the fruit ahead of its time?

Sort of. The present state of the cosmos is out of kilter. The signs are everywhere. The comsos is not perfect, but it is not chaos, like the Babylonians and Homer thought. It reeks of lost perfection. Nature is beautiful, but has a marred beauty. Forest fires, whirlpools, the savagery of animals, thorns and thistles, exist alongside virginal forests, the meekness and beauty and elegance of animals, roses and lotuses. Aeons ago the lion and the lamb could take naps together and cuddle. Farming was easier. Perhaps the tides of the ocean and the cycles of nature were more harmonous. Even the heavens are implicated in this fall, it seems to me. Asteroids shouldn't strike planets and stars shouldn't die. Perhaps, aeons ago, the orbits of the planets were perfect circles, like Aristotle thought.

That's ridiculous.

Well, maybe I got a little carried away. But that's why I think natural disasters are due to man's fall.

But why did man fall? Why was his will corrupted? Why was it corruptible?

Those are two different questions. It was corruptible because God wanted to create free creatures, little gods, like himself. A fully actualized, perfected will would be automaton, but an unactualized, nonwill would be a mere animal (and God already made plenty of those). So he had to create a being with the capacity for a complete will, but without that capacity fully realized yet. Our job (Adam's job) was to actualize it, to grow his will like he grew the garden. It would have taken time, and trust in God, but it would have happened eventually.

Then why didn't it?

Adam's will was corrupted because Satan tempted him.

That is what doesn't make sense to me, Lucy.

Why not?

Well, Adam fell through his flesh. But Satan didn't have flesh, did he? He is pure intellect.

True.

So how did Satan fall? Did someone tempt him?

That is much harder... Are you sure you want to go there? I thought you were reading about the fall of Adam.

It's one question. Adam fell because of Satan. If Satan hadn't fallen, hadn't become corrupt, then Adam wouldn't have.

He could have fallen for the same reason Satan did...

But still, at least he would have had a much better chance. Also, how can you say 'Adam could have fallen the same way Satan did' without knowing how Satan fell?

Here's a few guesses. Satan had a choice to worship God or not. He chose not to, and so fell.

Why wouldn't he want to worship God?

I don't know. The Bible says he fell through envy. The traditional answer is that he fell through pride. Pride and envy must be the same thing, or at least closely related.

But isn't pride a sin?

Yes.

And isn't "falling" a synonym for "sinning"?

Yes.

So saying "he fell through pride" is like saying "he sinned through pride," and "he fell through sin." So it's like saying "he sinned through sin." The quesiton is, how did he sin? Saying he "sinned through sin" is not answering the question be re-stating it.

I hadn't thought of that.

So how was pride even possible?

Well, angels are free, like men. So perhaps his will was unactualized.

But you just said earlier that man's will is unactualized, incomplete, and that he was the only such creature. Animals don't have wills, and angels have already completed wills, if they have wills at all.

They act, don't they? They are agents, so they must have wills, or whatever it is in us that gives us the capacity to act for reasons.

But still, how could Satan's will be unactualized such that he could corrupt himself?

Perhaps the angels, at the first instant of their creation, did have unactualized wills. They had "time" (though of course not our time) for one, single, total decision. At that "instant" or "moment", they received from God as gift both their existence and their freedom, both their knowledge and their opportunity to act on their knowledge. Each angel, of which there are presumably billions, received that existence, that knowledge, and that freedom. Each angel faced the same crisis. For every dangerous crossroad is a crisis. To embrace God, the Giver, and to embrace His gift, themselves -- or to embrace the gift, their own selves, and reject the giver?

You seem to know an awful lot about the angels at the first moment of their creation, Lucy.

These are just guesses, Zach. Reasonable guesses, I hope, as they are based on what we do know about God, and about ourselves, and about angels in general. But guesses nonetheless.

But I'm still worried by one thing.

What's that?

So Satan had --

-- And all the angels.

— So Satan and all the angels had the same choice as man? And some chose to reject God?

Yes, the crisis: to trust God and to receive their own being as a gift and give it back to God as a grace. Or to distrust God and turn from him, to take the gift without thanksgiving, without giving grace. Or look at another image: In the beginning, we know, the Word was with God and was "facing" God. So picture a million million angels created fully at an instant, all facing him as a million points on a circle face the center, with a million concentric circles radiating out from that point, all trillion facing the center. At that instant, they are perfectly arranged. They cannot change their place, since they were arranged by God like diamonds on a crown. But they are free to continuing looking toward the center or turn away, to face outside the circle. About a third of that trillion chose to look away, and that was their sin, their fall.

That is an arresting image, Lucy, but I haven't voiced my worry.

Oh, sorry. What is it?

Why would some turn away from the center? What possible reason could they have for rejecting the giver?

Maybe they were blinded by the brilliance of God. Maybe they envied that incredible intellectual light full of love, and turned away to shield their eye. Or maybe they were attracted by curiosity to look outside the circle. Presumably, since God is all, to turn away from him is to turn to the void. To look away from everything that is or could possibly exist, to turn away from the very condition of existence, is by definition to turn towards the nothingness. Maybe they were drawn by the infinite potential of nothingness.

That doesn't satisfy me at all. The way I see it, the reason they turned away was either itself sinful, or it was not. If the reason was not itself sinful, like your "shielding their eyes" reason -- in which case why would God hold them accountable for the sin of turning away? If the reason was itself sinful, like being attracted by the void more than by God, then that very reason, that very attraction, is sinful, and so that was their fall. Their reason for turning was sinful, not the turning itself.

Hm, that seems right, Zach.

So why would God make intellectual creatures such that His own brilliance blinds them or such that his power and beauty offends them? Or why would God make creatures such that the void attracts them? What you said puts God at fault for making creatures incapable of fully loving him for Who He Is, either by making them unable to withstand his brilliance, or by making them attracted to both good and to the absence of good, to the void. What's more, some angels didn't fall, some points on the concentric circles didn't turn their faces away from the center. So why do some fall and some not? Was the same motive for falling in all of them, but some acted on it, and some didn't? Or was the motive only in !some of them? If it was in some of them, then God must have put it there, since, on your story, they made the decision at the first instant of their being. There was no time for new motives to arise or mixed motives to be sorted -- they just decided.

I agree that it doesn't make sense for God to have made a million million creatures of various degrees of intellectual glory with equally various motives. Plus, Holy Scripture seems to indicate that some angels of all types and orders fell. Satan himself was one of the Seraphim, the highest order, according to Dionysius.

Exactly. So they all had the same crisis, the same motives. But they were not created already sinful, unless God is a trickster. Yet only some fell. What could possibly explain both of those facts?

I don't know. Let's inquire a little deeper. Satan's motive, the timeslice of his psychological state at the moment of his creation but "before" his fall, could not have been itself sinful, according to my hypothesis. So that means his motives were good, but his action was sinful.
