## Course Description:  
Each of us will have to face hard decisions regarding our own health and that of our parents, children, other relatives, and friends. This course attempts to help us to think clearly and hopefully to act well when those decisions come. 

Philosophy in generally asks questions about foundations of the world and our knowledge of it: what is real, how do we know what we know, what is the meaning of life? In health care, we ask about foundations: what is life? Death? What is the proper allocation of limited resources? Are there moral constraints on research? Is it ever more loving to lie to a patient about the hard truth? Is it ever more compassionate to euthanize an elderly person? Is it worth the emotional and psychological cost to avoid pregnancy by abortion? Is government-provided healthcare a right? 

These questions and more we will attempt to answer by clarifying terms, establishing secure ethical principles, being sensitive to contextual details, identifying reasonable answers, evaluating arguments for and against each reasonable answer, and coming to our own conclusions. Though we will consider arguments from Kantian, consequentialist, and religious standpoints, our official approach to these questions will be from the standpoint of traditional virtue ethics.

Each of us belongs to a tradition and a community. Our goal is to understand our own tradition and understand rival traditions, and why they disagree. We will disagree, but do so peacably and with understanding. 

## Course Goals: 
Our goal is to think hard about hard questions and to discard wrong answers and discover and prove right answers to these questions. The hard questions will revolve around life, death, health, and sickness, but may branch out to related tangents including logic, public policy, anthropology, religion, law, and more. 

In short, our goals are

* to understand health care as a part of life, a sub-discipline of ethical philosophy, a part of public policy, and a part of applied medicine. 
* by critically analyzing and discussing articles, books, studies, and news articles about health and sickness, to understand our own ethical tradition better and make clear plans for how to make hard decisions
* Also to understand the tradition of others (religious ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics) in approaching ethical issues;
* and thereby to become more virtuous people capable of handling difficult life circumstances.

## Scope and Sequence:
To accomplish these goals, this 16-week course is divided into into 10 Units of 1-2 weeks each, plus an Introductory Unit on philosophy and ethics and a Final Unit studying for the exam.

 Each unit consists of four components: 
(a) 4-6 readings (with some reading quizzes)  
(b) 2 interactive lectures   
(c) 2 student-lead discussions, and   
(d) a Unit Paper.  

Your grade for the class will depend on your performance in each component, plus tests and applicable extra credit. 

Each unit will have 4 readings (usually from the Contemporary Bioethics book), 2 class discussions, and 1 synthesis Unit Paper. 

##Grading

|  Assessment category  |  Percent of semester grade |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Readings (Quiz, Self-reports) |         20%   |  
| Participation (Talking, writing, presentations) |   20% |
| Tests (Midterm, Final)         |  30% |
| Unit Papers (6 papers, pass/fail) |  30% |

Your best bet for getting an ‘A’ is to (a) read carefully every week, (b) come to class and engage, talk, write, (c) study for the tests, and (d) write the Unit Papers according to the given instructions.

##Required Books:  

* **Pierce and Randels, Contemporary Bioethics. Oxford, 2010. First Edition** ($80 new, $25 used, #14 rent,)

Other required readings will be posted to Blackboard. 

Except for the second week, all of our readings will come from the Contemporary Bioethics anthology. Your goal in reading is to understand. Reflect on what you’ve read. Short reading quizzes will assess whether your eyeballs hit the page and whether you comprehended what you read. 

## Participation:  ##

You must take responsibility for your own learning. You are expected to participate in three ways: (a) attend, (b) talk or write, and (c) do Critical Reading and Group Presentations.


### Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. I’ll take roll. You have a maximum of five (5) “free” absences to use for any reason. Use these freebies for sick days, personal day, or just taking the day off. After five, points will be deducted from your participation grade. Except for a few reasons (serious illness, death in family) I won’t grant extra absences. 

### Talking/writing
Almost every class will be discussion-oriented. This is an upper division course so come ready to talk and share your viewpoint, disagree with others, be patient, listen, and think. You are expected to talk in class at least once per week. Some “external processors” will find this easy. Some “internal processors” will find this hard. Stretch yourself! Since we are also writing Unit Papers every 2 weeks, external processors will find this hard, internal processors easy. So everyone can stretch themselves. Stretch yourself! 
Discussion will be the key to this class. I’ve removed as much “busy work” as possible. You just have to read, show up to class ready to listen, talk, and learn. 

There is a natural ebb and flow to participation, so some days you may talk a lot, some not at all. But in general, make it a personal goal to contribute a thought or question once per day, or 3 times per week. The amount you learn from this class is directly proportional to how much you challenge yourself to read, talk, think, and write. 

If you prefer not to talk as much in class, you may elect to submit your notes or reflections every week for participation points. This is not instead of speaking in class, since I may still call on you.
You must take responsibility for your own learning. 

### Critical Reading and Group Presentation
You will form groups of 2-3. You will be assigned an article. You will “critically read” that article (instructions will be provided). Then you will present your critical reading to the class, and kickstart the discussion with your questions. Each Group will present twice in the semester. The instructions for this assignment are posted on Canvas. 

Tests: There is a midterm and final. The test questions and answers will be given to you ahead of time to study and memorize. We will discuss them in class. You have time, before the test, to ask questions if you do not understand a particular item. The tests will assess your knowledge of (a) definitions of key philosophical terms, (b) historical facts relevant to health care ethics, (c) major health care questions and (d) the arguments for and against major answers to these major questions. 

### Unit Papers:  ###

Every 2 weeks or so, you will write a short philosophical essay answering the given question. These Unit Papers help you synthesize your own views after doing the readings and listening to lectures and participating in the discussions. You do not need agree with the instructor; you need to write what you actually think and what you can defend with arguments and evidence. Answer the question, showing familiarity with the course materials.

Each paper must argue a thesis and state objections, and reply to objections. This format may be unfamiliar to some. Follow the instructions closely.

I will not tolerate plagiarism — unintentional or intentional. Be careful to cite your sources correctly. If I detect plagiarism, I will contact you. The assignment will receive a zero, and disciplinary action may follow. 

Instructions for this assignment are posted online on Canvas under “Pages” — “Unit Paper Instructions” 

## Extra Credit: 

Some will need or want extra credit. If you elect to take optional extra credit, there are two ways to do so (you may choose one or the other, but not both).  

You may either (a) volunteer to do extra research preparation for one class discussion and help me to lead the discussion that day by presenting your research; or (b) volunteer to do extra research on a particular topic and write an extra paper on that topic presenting your research. 



## Miscellany. 
1. Bring your book every day. 
2. Laptop/tablet users must sit in the front row — and no smartphones allowed. 
3. Be respectful of others: no teasing, and pay attention when a neighbor is talking. 
4. If you need to take a text message or phone call, step out, respond, and come back. 
5. I will read every email but may not respond to every email. If I don’t respond within three (3) business days, email again with the subject “nudge”.
6. For short, quick questions, use Twitter (@keith_buhler)
7. Disabilities can be accommodated if you are registered with the Disability Resource Center. See http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/DisabilityResourceCenter/
8. Plagiarism has been an issue. Even unintentional plagiarism earns a zero for the assignment and, in intentional or egregious cases, failing the course and receiving a permanent mark on your academic record. You’ll submit your papers to SafeAssign on Blackboard to help avoid accidental plagiarism. Don’t even think about stealing someone else’s thought/work. 


## Course Outline: 

*Refer to this outline weekly to keep on track with this class.*

##### WEEK 1: What is Health Care Ethics?

Wed Aug 26:    Syllabus Day   (No reading due):    
Expectations for Success

Today, we get to know each other. And we identify expectations for this class. What can you hope to get out of it? What do I expect of your reading, writing, and discussions? Make sure to buy your book, download the handouts. Also, review this syllabus. Then start reading!
3x5 cards for names; Form groups 1-10.  

Fri Aug 28:    Read Bioethics 1-25 (25 pages):  Discussion on Health Care and Philosophy. 

Do Reading Quiz 1. 
After studying this long and interesting introduction, answer the 19 quiz questions. What is the purpose of health care? Philosophy and critical thinking can help in defining health care and deciding on hard cases. Does healthcare have an end (a purpose, a point)? Yes. I’ll present some options and argue what the purpose is. Is that end to provide for patient health (objective) or to satisfy patient preference (subjective)? To prevent patient sickness and death (negative) or to promote patient health (positive)? Does cosmetic surgery fall under this definition of healthcare?  We’ll use these considerations as an introduction to philosophical analysis, and group discussion.

WEEK 2: Truth, and Goodness
Mon Aug 31:    Plato’s Apology handout (20 pages):    Life, Death, and Devouring Time. 
Reading Quiz 2. 
Before we dive into the textbook, let’s think about life in general. ‘Devouring time’ means that death comes for all. How do we live well in light of this fact? Socrates is an example: Socrates’ death is upon him. He is being sentenced for practicing annoying philosophy, for “believing in new gods” and for “corrupting the youth.” Also, with Socrates’ martyrdom, philosophy is born. His teaching is that we should care more for the soul than the body. Still, the body is important.  Health care ethics is about caring for the body but also involves psychology, politics, and religion. The Apology is a dramatic introduction to the importance of critical thinking in all these areas, and a persuasive defense of  “soul care”. 


W Sept 2:      “Truth” and “Relativism” Handouts (6 pages):  Science, Religion, and Truth. 
Reading Quiz 3. 
The problem of disagreement arises when we notice that people disagree about what is true, real, good, or beautiful. Is there any right answer? What is truth? Is it objective? Since we are seeking truth all semester, we must consider the best arguments for and against the existence of objective truth, especially in light of the “problem of disagreement.” Today’s session will challenge your presuppositions. It is absolutely necessary for our shared inquiry this semester that we all follow reason both as a procedure and a doctrine. 

Unit Paper 1 prompt: What is your health care code? (due next Wed, Sept 9)
Check the “Unit Papers” Handout online for detailed instructions. Do not attempt to write this paper before reading the detailed instructions. 

F Sept 4:   “Goodness” Handout (10 pages):  The Tao. 
Reading Quiz 4.  (optional) Fill out “Get to know you survey”
First we will go over how to do Critical Reading and Group Presentation assignments. Then we’ll discuss “the Tao.” Is morality relative to a culture or tradition? We will examine the evidence for and against the claim that morality is objective and universal for all people. The “hard cases” make it seem relative, but the “easy cases” make it seem absolute. Examine the “Illustrations of the Tao” handout to see what common moralities cross time and space and culture. (Then read the “Common Morality” handout of Buchamp and Childress for their take on the Tao.) Then read the Kreeft “Is the Moral Law Objective?” handout. Are these arguments persuasive? How does the Tao square with your own tradition (whether religious, secular, or other)? For this semester, we will proceed on the claim that some moral laws are objective, binding, and good. But how can we deepen our knowledge of our own tradition and our understanding of others’?
WEEK 3: Doctors and Patients I
M Sept 7:   LABOR DAY — NO CLASS

W Sept 9:   Unit Paper 1:  What is your Health Care Code?

W Sept 9:   Bioethics 29-49 (20 pages):   The Hippocratic Oath.

Howard Markel, “I swear by Apollo” On taking the Hippocratic Oath — Group 1 presents
The Hippocratic Oath has been and still is an importance piece of the medical profession. How do the old and the new versions relate? What rules should be discarded and what retained? 

F Sept 11: Bioethics 49-63 (14):    Matthew Wynia, et. al., Medical Professionalism in Society — Group 2. 
Reading Quiz 6. 
This will be one of few Fridays that is not a discussion day. Because of labor day, we’ll begin a conversation about the doctor-patient relationship. What are the doctor’s obligations? The patient’s obligations? Does a doctor have “power” and if so how should it be wielded? Is cosmetic surgery within the purview of medicine? 
WEEK 4: Doctors and Patients II
M Sept 14:     Bioethics 87-94 (8 pp):  Groopman, The Patient’s Work — Group 3
Reading Quiz 7.

M Sept 21:  Bioethics 130-137 (7 pp): Bernat, Whole Brain Concept of Death — Group 5
Reading Quiz 9. 
Read Introduction 115-130. Lecture. What is death? Separation of soul and body? Heart failure? The absence of brain functioning? Non-existence, annihilation? How does Bernat define death? SDistinguish the whole-brain, higher-brain, and brain-stem criteria of death. Do you find Bernat’s support for the whole-brain formulation over the other two criteria persuasive? In the final analysis, Bernat’s support for the whole-brain formulation rests on its public policy success, in spite of its biological and philosophical shortcomings. Is Bernat’s position ethically justified? 

**Updated**W Sept 23:   Unit Paper 2: (Health care provider majors:) Would you ever deceive a patient? Why or why not? (Non-provider majors:) Would you ever want the doctor to deceive you? Why or why not?

W Sept 23:  Bioethics 147-163  (16 pp): Leon Kass, The Case for Mortality (147-155) — Group 6

Voluntary Euthanasia: A Utilitarian Perspective (206-213) — Lecture. 
Should the rule against killing apply to the competent person who determines that it would be better to die? From a utilitarian perspective, does it make sense to limit euthanasia to terminally or incurably ill patients? Is the slippery slope argument against euthanasia convincing? 

W Sep 30:   Bioethics 213-227 (14 pp): Wolf, Gender, Feminism, and Death (217-227) — Group 8
Reading Quiz 12
How might gender dynamics impact PAS and euthanasia?  Are women more vulnerable than are men for nonvoluntary PAS and euthanasia? Is a rights framework an appropriate way to approach PAS and euthanasia? What does feminist analysis add to the ethical debate? 
Keown, End of Life: the Buddhist View (213-217) — Lecture. Because Buddhism lacks a central authority, could Buddhist values be used to by individual buddhists to justify euthanasia? Would it be possible to aim at death while also being compassionate?

F Oct 2:    Bioethics 239-245 (6 pp):  Discussion
Slow Medicine — if a 90 year old patient has not communicated her preferences, would slow medicine be in her best interest? Anybody in there? — In writing your own living will, how would Owen’s findings influence your instructions to others regarding your treatment should you be diagnosed with PVS? Did Katie’s parents do well by her? Do you think it can ever be in a newborn’s best interests to discontinue treatment and be allowed to die?

M Oct 5:    Bioethics 247-263 (16 pp): Abortion and the Beginning of Life — Lecture
Read this excellent introduction to a difficult topic. I will lead a lecture and discussion through some of the legal and moral issues, including the history of abortion law, the definition of “soul”, and the concept of human personhood. 

W Oct 7:    Bioethics 265-290 (25 pp): Thomson, A Defense of Abortion — Group 9. 
Reading Quiz 13. 
Many pro-lifers assume that if a fetus is a human being, then abortion is wrong. Thomson assumes a fetus is a human and argues that abortion can still be acceptable. Would it be morally acceptable to unplug yourself from the violinist? Does the duration of time matter? Are Tomson’s analogies really analogous to pregnancy?

F Oct 9:    Bioethics 335-341 (6 ): Marquis, Abortion & End of Human Life 
To kick off this discussion day, we’ll examine the Marquis article together. Does Marquis provide a persuasive argument against the standard view? Would the future of value view prohibit all abortions? Discussion: Is abortion justified? If so, under what conditions? If not, why not? 
WEEK 8: At the Beginnings of Life II
M Oct 12:  Bioethics 290-300 (10): Kaczor, Could Artificial Wombs End Abortion Debate? —Group 10
Should ethical abortion involve the right to terminate the fetus, or only the right to terminate the pregnancy (via evacuation)?

WEEK 9: Getting Health Care I
M Oct 19:   Bioethics 371-382 AND 386-395, Introduction & Daniels, Justice, Health, and Health Care — Group 1
Access to health care, rationing, medical justice, organizational ethics, and organ transplant. How much should individual health care cost, and can it be free? Who should pay for it — individuals, insurance, government, charities? 
If healthcare is “special,” what makes it so? Should efforts to ensure justice in health outcomes focus on social conditions in addition to access to health care? Will following Daniel’s four conditions ensure justice in the allocating of health care resources?
Reading Quiz 15 is for the birds.

W Oct 21:   Bioethics 396-404 (8): Engelhardt, Rights to Health Care Allocations — Group 2
Is Engelhardt correct that humans do not share a common view of justice and beneficence? Are the natural and social lotteries as readily distinguishable as Engelhardt claims? Should the unfortunate also have a right to health care? Should the unfortunate also have a right to receive health care? What are the advantages and disadvantages of Engelhardt’s “Proposed diverse health care packages”? Engelhardt lauds “open democratic dialogue” as a way to “fashion a basic package of healthcare for all citizens.” How does this notion compare with Daniels for procedural justice conditions for distributing healthcare?
Reading Quiz 16.

F Oct 23:   Bioethics 477-482 (5):  Discussion on Health Care
Case 1, Health of Nations. Based upon these comparisons, does the U. S. healthcare system seem unjust? Case 2, the “Commonwealth” of MA. Do you think MA’s healthcare plan is just?  Case 3, Should Illegal Immigrants Have Access to Care? Do illegal immigrants (ii) have a right to health care? Do health care facilities have a duty to provide it? or is providing such care praiseworthy but not required?  Case 4, Blue Cross Seeks Physician information 1. Bluecross was asking physicians to be gatekeepers of medical resources. Is it appropriate for doctors to take on that role?  Case 5, Age-Based Rationing. 1. do you think it is just to ration healthcare on the basis of age rather than relative need? And more! 

WEEK 10: Getting Health Care II 
M Oct 26: Bioethics 412-419 (7): James Dwyer, Illegal Immigrants, Social Responsibility—Group 3
Dwyer argues that our attitude toward and treatment of illegal or undocumented immigrants should not be viewed through the lense of desert nor professional ethics, but “social responsibility”.  Is desert the appropriate material criterion of justice for access to healthcare? Would California's proposition 187 justly or unjustly denied healthcare to illegal immigrants? Is social ethics easily distinguishable from bioethics? What is the social responsibility of United States regarding illegal immigrants?
Reading Quiz 17. 

W Oct 28:   Bioethics 460-464 (4): Barbro Bjorkman — Donate but not sell? — Group 4
Barbro Bjorkman observes that we intuitively judge it to be wrong to sell our organs, but right to donate them. She offers an explanation based on reflection of what the virtuous person would do — the person who is courageous and generous. 1. Do the arguments supporting organ sales correlate with your moral intuitions? 2. Is it possible to be a virtuous person and not being organ donor? 3. Are there any situations where virtuous person might sell rather than donate organs? 4. What can be done to increase your society's sense of virtue? What is the probability that such projects will be successful?

M Nov 2:    Unit Paper 4 — Should the U.S. move toward universal health care or not? If so, should it do so through government health care or private? If not, why not? 

M Nov 2:    Bioethics 487-502 (15):       Clinical Research 
Clinical research is a key part of biomedical advances to cure or prevent diseases and improve people’s quality of life. The “cost” of such research is more than dollars. People, animals, stem cells are the objects of most controversial clinical research. Today, we explore the landscape of clinical research and the bioethical boundaries. We research on (1) humans, (2) human stem cells, and (3) animals. What are the limits on research and the benefits? 
Reading Quiz 19

W Nov 4:  Bioethics 507-515 (8):  “The Nuremberg Code” and “Belmont Report” — Group 5
The Nuremberg Code came out of the Nuremberg trials of Nazi doctors. It is like the Belmont Report, which initiated a new era of biomedical or health care ethics. Is this document on the right track? Completely right? In need of correction? Completely off? How does the report distinguish between practice and research? Why is the first principle formulated as “respect for persons” and not “respect for autonomy”?  What two moral rules are embedded in the principle of beneficence? 4. How would you describe the methodological framework of the Report (refer to chapter 1 in this text for help)? 
Reading Quiz 20

F Nov 6:    Bioethics 572-576 (4):  Research Discussion 
Is Medicare coercive?  Can animals feel and express empathy?  Do pharmaceutical companies have moral obligations to research some diseases? We’ll discuss the first 3 or 4 cases on these pages. 

WEEK 12: Biomedical Research II
M Nov 9:     Bioethics 537-556:  Stem Cells
Bioethics 537-544 (8):     Monitoring Stem Cell Research (Group 6/lecture)
Presidential Council on Bioethics. What are embryonic stem cells, and what is their potential scientific and medical value? What broader moral issues underlie the debate about stem cell research? Why is the term “embryo” problematic? Why is “moral status” problematic? What are the core moral issues in embryonic stem cell research? 

Bioethics 544-556 (12): Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cell Research — (Lecture) 
Consider these Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and other testimonies on stem cell research. Where do the various religions agree? Where do they disagree? Which (if any) of these considerations are applicable to public policy? 
Reading Quiz 21


W Nov 11:   Bioethics 556-564 (8):     Ethics of Animal Research — Group 7
What is your view on the moral status of animals? How would you characterize DeGrazia’s own view? How does your view compare with DeGrazia’s? How is the debate about animal research similar to and different from the debate about stem cell research? 
Reading Quiz 22

F Nov 13:   Bioethics 576-580 (4):     Discussion
Is stem cell research on “dead” embryos any better than live ones? Should apes be subject to protection from research? Rats? 

Unit Paper 5 Prompt:    Comparing research on fetal organs with research on animals, are both wrong or both right, or one right and the other wrong? Why? (Due Nov 20)



WEEK 13: Genetics and Posthuman Possibilities 

M Nov 16:   Bioethics 581-596 (15):    Introduction & Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness
What might dissuade us from genetic intervention? What might attract us?

W Nov 18:   Bioethics 619-625 (6):  Bostrom, Transhumanist Values — Group 8 
What is a posthuman? A transhuman? How does Bostrom characterize the posthuman project? What might a transhumanist say about the distinction between theory and enhancement? 

Bioethics 639-646 (7) —  Davis, Genetic Dilemmas, Child’s Rights — Group 9
How does Davis want to reconceive the moral conflict faced by genetic counselors working with parents who want to have a child with a disability? What does a child’s right to an open future encompass? 
Quiz 23

F Nov 20:   Bioethics 598-606 (8):  Sandel, The Case Against Perfection — Group 10
What is wrong with designer children, bionic athletes? What is the notion of “giftedness”? How valuable is it? Sandel argues that humility, openness, reverence, beholding are values at stake in our “intoxicated” drive for total mastery over ourselves and our children. What is the value of these things, and how do they balance against the values of mastery, dominion, and molding? 

Discussion: Is there human nature? Will technology help us transcend it? Is technology evolving now the way biology has been evolving before? Do cultural differences make a big deal?

Optional Guardian article on Calico.

F Nov 20 Unit Paper 5: Comparing research on fetal organs with research on animals, are both wrong or both right, or one right and the other wrong? Why? 

WEEK 14: The Environmental Turn 
M Nov 23:   Bioethics 661-667, 670-674  (10)  Introduction; Wendell Berry “Health is Membership”
Barry argues that health is not a possession of individuals but of communities. And not just communities. The health of soil, animal, and human is inextricably bound together in one whole. He argues against the mechanistic analogy of the heart as “a pump” and the mind as “a computer,” and shows how the false assumption harms patients in hospitals. Food and rest are essential to health yet are ignored in hospital settings. Berry ends with a series of questions. Try your best to think about the answers

W-F Nov 25-27: THANKSGIVING BREAK 

WEEK 15: Environment Turn II 
M Nov 30:   Bioethics 681-690 (9) — Pierce, New Ways of Thinking about Bioethics — lecture
Today we discuss some of the deeper ecological ethics of climate change, green energy, and communitarian values. 

W Dec 2:    Bioethics 704-713 (9): Deep Ecology & End of life care — lecture
How does “deep ecology” connect with broader bioethical issues?
