### Why Study Philosophy?

What can I do with a philosophy degree? (Nothing much...except *everything*.)

1. Some assume you can’t “do” anything with a philosophy degree. Some tease that you'll work in a coffee shop asking people *why* they want creme with that. 
2. Philosophy is just a waste of time. according to Arthur Koestler's: "the systematic abuse of a terminology specially invented for that purpose." It's just sharing your opinion -- who cares?

On the other hand, a philosophy degree has been called ["the most practical major"](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/10/is-philosophy-the-most-practical-major/246763/), the "ultimate transferable job skill," and of course -- *all* people by nature desire to know (Aristotle, *Metaphysics* I.1.)

I answer, you should study philosophy for three reasons:   
(1) philosophy will help you achieve your career goals in law, business, ministry, journalism, counseling, politics, homemaking, education, or academia.   
(2) philosophy will help you live a successful life and be happy;   
(3) you love philosophy as an end in itself;  

If one *or more* reasons applies to you, consider a philosophy major or minor. Let's look at each in a bit more detail. 


## Philosophy as a means to your career goals: 
1. Philosophy on average [make better money than business majors](http://www.payscale.com/2008-best-colleges/degrees.asp), are [#1 for mid-career growth](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10224324/Website/philosophy-income.jpg). 
3. Since philosophers learn the [“ultimate transferable work skill”](http://www.cep.unt.edu/times.html) they are almost never unemployed. You may never beat the salary of a surgeon, Hollywood star, or best-selling author, but you virtually always find fun, challenging, fulfilling jobs, and make plenty doing it — more, in fact, than majors in chemistry, biology, and psychology.

2. Studying philosophy helps you master the most universal and lucrative [job skills]( http://www.forbes.com/2010/02/18/most-important-job-skills-personal-finance-universal.html). Communication, argument, teamwork, creativity, curiosity are the meta-skills — they apply to every discipline and any working professional, including the most important jobs in the world, being a husband or wife, father or mother, lover or friend. 
- Philosophy study helps you to **communicate**: Good philosophy communicates across languages and cultures across generations, centuries, even millennia. A philosophy major means you have spent hundreds of hours reading, writing, listening to, and making arguments in an attempt to communicate clearly.  
4. Philosophy helps you to **argue**: [Ideas have consequences.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideas_Have_Consequences) Arguments rule the world — all the practices of government, public policy, business enterprise, scientific advancement, and even religious communities play out in practice the conclusions of good arguments. A philosophy major means you have read and written and understood dozens of dense, complicated, and sophisticated arguments. 
5. Philosophy helps you acclimate to high-level **teamwork**: Every employer, company, family — virtually every human group — lives and breathes cooperative collaboration. A philosophy major means you have engaged in hundreds of hours of careful conversation, problem-solving, and verbal interaction especially in a group. 
4. **Creativity**: Innovation drives business, law, science, and medicine. While employers are increasingly desperate for it, many educational practices actually stifle our native creativity. A philosophy major means you have spent years encouraging (nay, demanding) the acquisition of the invaluable habit of [thinking outside the box.]( "To Beat the Market, Hire a Philosopher", New York Times.s)
5. **Curiosity**: As children, everyone philosophizes, but most of us have the wonder beaten out of us somehow or another. Einstein or somebody said “Never lose a holy curiosity.” A philosophy major means you have cultivated this innate germ, however small, into a disciplined, reliable skill you can apply to any area of life. 

2. Philosophy majors excel in a [wide variety of careers](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2007/nov/20/choosingadegree.highereducation). Who majored in philosophy? Your professors. But not *just* your professors. Philosophy departments have churned out a one or two people you may have heard of, including: 
* U.S. Presidents (Thomas Jefferson)
* filmmakers (Wes Anderson)
* musicians (Philip Glass)
* actors (Woody Allen)
* comedians (Steve Martin)
* CEOs (AOL-Time Warner)
* Politicians (Carly Fiorina)
* and Popes (John Paul II)

You can’t say the same for [underwater basket weaving.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_basket_weaving) 

What other careers is philosophy study good for? 

**Professorships**: This is the obvious, but by no means the only, path a philosophy degree can follow. All of your philosophy professors, and many others (professors of English, law, history, linguistics, public policy, political science, engineering) studied philosophy at some point. 
Management: Good thinkers are better leaders. A philosophy degree can set you on a path towards personnel, financial aid, or public relations, in diverse settings such as college or university, prisons, hospitals, government agencies (county, state or federal), and, of course, the companies we buy from every day.

**Law**: Lawyers are really philosophers trained in a specific sub-field, namely some particular legal system. They make and critique arguments for a living. Law students are famously subjected to a distinctly philosophical form of on-the-spot classroom quizzes known as the Socratic method.

**Religious & Psychological Leadership**: The aspiring pastors, priests, rabbis, imams, as well as counselors, social workers, therapists, and leaders of non-profit companies specialize in thinking about the big picture and walking with people through life’s toughest problems. Philosophical training is part-and-parcel with wondering where we came from, who we are, and the ultimate meaning of our final destination. 

**Business**: The ability to look at old problems in new ways is invaluable in business management, sales, consulting public relations, fund raising, systems analysis, advertising, and banking

**Sales/Insurance**: What is sales but persuasion? Phil. grads can become successful, agents, brokers, salesmen, sales managers, and marketing directors.
Government: Have an eye on office? Check out the list of folks who started in Philosophy 101 and ended up congressional staff members, in federal agencies and bureaus, state and local governments, the United Nations, foreign service, or cultural affairs.

**Foreign service & diplomacy**: The philosophical ability to discover unconscious assumptions and collaboratively work around them is particularly important when working with people of different cultures. 

**Journalism**: Newscasters, journalists, reporters and critics (of books, art, film) have to hone the ability of asking the perfect question and delivering lots of information in a concise and understandable manner. 

**Publishing/Writing**: There's always a shortage of people who are good at expressing themselves on paper (or online), in sales, editing, management, freelance, technical writing for a company or government, and script writer

**Public service**: Both politicians and career public servants benefit from the ability to identify, define and solve (an astonishing variety of) problems.

And more. If it’s good enough for Han Solo, it’s good enough for you. Here’s a small sampling.

## Philosophy can help you live life and be happy ##


## Philosophy as an end in itself 

Perhaps the most compelling reason to study philosophy is that you are (or think you might be) a philosopher at heart. You can’t help it. 

But that’s not the only reason. You might just need it to launch your career and your life into the direction you’re headed. So go ahead, think about it. Talk to your professor about it. 

Then, ask hard questions, read hard books, make hard arguments, and find out where it takes you.

*That’s* what you can do with a philosophy major.
