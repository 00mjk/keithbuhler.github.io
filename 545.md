### Course Description: 

This course is a survey of central topics in the philosophy of religion, including faith and reason, religious experience, the existence of God, miracles, revelation, the problem of evil, providence and foreknowledge, survival after death, religious language, and religious diversity.  Readings will be drawn primarily from contemporary authors and will focus on western theism, although there will also be some attention to eastern religions.  After reading a variety of articles on the aforementioned topics, we will read a recent monograph dealing with arguments for the existence of God, *Natural Signs and Knowledge of God* by C. Stephen Evans.

Our goals are: 

* To become familiar with current controversies and topics in philosophy of religion;
* To develop a thoughtful, rational, Christian world-view
* 

### Texts

* Michael Peterson et al., eds., *Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings* (Oxford UP), Fourth edition
* C. Stephen Evans, *Natural Signs and Knowledge of God* (Oxford UP)
* Further readings posted online.


### Grading
Your grade for the class will depend on your performance in reading and writing philosophical papers. Papers will be medium-to-short weekly papers, and one final paper. There is no test. 


|  Assessment category  |  Percent of semester grade |
| -----------------------| -----------------------|
| Participation          |  10% |
| Weekly papers          |  60% |
| Term Paper             |  30% |


### Unit Papers:  
Weekly papers will be written on that week's reading. The term paper will be a topic synthesizing one of the major issues and presenting an argument (probably a critique) about one of the major positions. Be careful to cite  sources correctly. I will not tolerate plagiarism â€” unintentional or intentional.  If I detect plagiarism, I will contact you. The assignment will receive a zero, and disciplinary action may follow. The instructions are posted online.
