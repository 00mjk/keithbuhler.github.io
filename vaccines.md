Title: To Vax or not to Vax?

# Should children be given vaccines?

1. **Objection 1**. It seems one ought to immunize one's children, for vaccines are safe and effective. Since the 1900s, they have effictively eliminated rubella, diphtheria, smallpox, polio, and whooping cough.
2. **Objection 2**. All scientists and medical doctors agree that children should be given vaccines, so abstaining from vaccination is anti-science. 
3. **Objection 3**. The only reason not to vaccinate is a hysterical fear of autism, but the alleged correlation between autism and vaccination has been debunked. 
4. **Objection 4**. If a few people don't get vaccinated, they ruin the herd immunity and put the entire population at risk, which is selfish, evil, and wrong.

2. **On the other hand**, Leslie Manookian and 150 scientists and physicians agree that we should defer this decision until we have more information. As Richard Moskowitz, M.D. has written: 

>"Faith in the magical power of drugs often blunts the critical senses, and comes close at times to a mass hysteria, involving scientists and laymen alike. Men want miracles as much today as in the past. If they do not join one of the newer cults, they satisfy this need by worshiping at the altar of modern science. This faith in the magical power of drugs is not new. It helped to give medicine the authority of a priesthood, and to recreate the glamour of ancient mysteries.

3. **I argue** that some vaccines are beneficial and that, for others, much more scientific research is needed before parents can make a safe judgment about early, often, closely clustered vaccination. 
4. I am pro-science and pro-reason and pro-public health. Unfortunately, science takes time. And many over-zealous activists have pushed technology products onto the general market before the scientific community had time to full vet the technology; this situation creates a "guinea pig" generation where the public, not the labratory, is used to test a new product. Recalls for drugs and machines and equipment happen every day. 
4. Many vaccines are pushed by big Pharmaceutical companies whose bottom line interest is not public health but in selling product. 
5. The immune system has a logic of its own that vaccinations do not respect and pro-vaxxers do not understand. They think that technology can achieve what poor mother nature cannot. 
6. Anecdotal evidence suggests a series of negative side effects to early, closely clustered, and numerous vaccinations. Almost all scientific study begins with anecdotes, research goals, hypotheses, etc. constructed outside of the lab. However, some who are already dogmatically allied to the view that vaccines do not have negative side effects refuse to study this possibility. 
7. Some diseases (such as measles) enter through the respiratory system and hence trigger an immune system response at that entry point. The immune system activates to fight the disease and prevent it from reaching major organs, triggering symptomatic responses such as coughing and sneezing. The measles vaccine, by contrast, enters directly into the blood stream and has access to major organs immediately. Latent viruses that are not rooted out by immune system antibodies are well-known to cause long-term, recurrent diseases such as herpes, shingles, warts, etc. and could possibly lead to the development of auto-immune disorders.[^1](http://healthimpactnews.com/2015/richard-moskowitz-m-d-the-case-against-immunizations/)
8. Many of the vax-activists are bullies; they use insults, hyperbole, brow-beating, legal compulsion, coercion, accusations of ignorance, stupidity, and anti-scientific bias instead of argument. When one's opponent cannot win with words but can only "win" with force, one wonders if one's opponent is right. 
9. Hubris is not science; pride, smug, arrogant and unearned self-righteousness is not science. But hubris in the name of science has committed many evils, including thalidomide babies, endorsing cigarrettes, and other public health disasters. 


1. **Reply 1**. Many of the diseases that have disappeared were already disappearing before the vaccine was introduced. Many outbreaks occur even in  vaccinated communities. Also, since the 1900s, we have seen the parabolic rise in auto-immune disorders. 
2. **Reply 2**. Actually, the scientific community is divided. One mustexamine the evidence for oneself and one must choose one's authorities. The pro-vaccination activists attempt to short-circuit the argument by fallaciously defining away disagreement to create the appearance of consensus. They then argue from this (false) consensus to the pro-vaccine conclusion. Assuming that all pro-vaxxers are correct and then concluding that, therefore, one ought to be a pro-vaxxer is circular reasoning. 
3. **Reply 3**. One does not have to be hysterical or afraid to judge that one course of action is superior to another. Some vaccines have been linked in anecdotal and trial evidence to fever, irritability, changes in temperment. The AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) defines "neative side effects" as reactions occuring no more than 30 days following immunization, which excludes from research ex hypothesi any chronic diseases. It also defines negative side effects as those "previously recognized to be linked" excludes the recognition of *new* possible. About 30,000 cases of adverse reactions to vaccines have been reported annually to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) since 1990, with 10-15% classified as serious, meaning associated with permanent disability, hospitalization, life-threatening illness, or death.([Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, "About the VAERS Program,"](www.vaers.hhs.gov (accessed Aug. 4, 2014))

4. **Reply 4**. Many of the outbreaks that have occurred occur in sufficiently vaccinated communities. Herd immunity has been tested and discovered to be vulnerable to disease mutation, vaccination expiration, and perhaps other unknown factors. 


## Summary

My attitude on vaccines comes from evidence, scientific research, testimony, and scientific authority, from doctors, the CDC, and others.(According to the CDC, all vaccines carry a risk of a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) in about one per million children.[ww.cdc.gov]((CDC, "Possible Side-Effects from Vaccines," www.cdc.gov, Feb. 4, 2014))

I was vaccinated and suffered no negative side effects. 

However, when my children were in utero, we did the research and discovered that the best scientific evidence and the scientific consensus of those whom we trust disfavors early, often, closely clustered vaccination. We are open to the evidence from all sides, and continue to research and discuss with doctors, friends, and fellow parents and to learn more about both sides of the argument. 

We do not believe that either side should be bullied into submission through mockery or legal coercion. Many of the arguments for vaccination are calm, reasonable, and worth considering. 

Unfortunately, many of the mainstay arguments from the pro-vax activist communnity are fallacious. They argue something like this: "100% of scientsts agree that we are right, therefore we are right. And those who disagree are anti-science, ignorant, stupid fanatics." This commits no less than six fallacies: appeal to authority, circular reasoning, and "No True Scotsman", ad hominem, and ad baculum or appeal to force.

**Authority**. Many scientists and physicians are pro-vaccine. I take their opinion seriously and respect their research. But very few research it; the rest take it on authority. Some of the "authorities" are not scientists but public policy makers. 

**Circular reasoning, and No True Scotsman**. Furthermore, The illusion of consensus is created by excluding from consideration those who disagree. 150 doctors and scientists are anti-vaxxers or against close, clustered, numerous vaccines. 

**Ad hominem and ad baculum.** Activists enjoy brow-beating  the other side. Many of the vax-activists are bullies; they do not argue very well, and they do not know the scientific research. Instead, they use name-calling, hyperbole, brow-beating, legal compulsion, political coercion, mockery, ridicule, and insulting accusations of ignorance, stupidity, and anti-scientific bias instead of argument. When one's opponent cannot win with words but can only "win" with force, one wonders if one's opponent is right. 

When asked for an argument they often beg the question, that is -- assume they are right. "I am right therefore I am right and you are wrong." Our doctor has been very polite; the pro-vax activists however are smug, self-rightous, irrational fanatics who believe that anyone who has actually researched the evidence must be mistaken because they must be right. 
Pro-vaxxers are fanatical about using public coercion to force an ill-understood product on the public against their will and without question.

I will not force my anti-vax views on anyone through public policy and coercion. Vaxxers will force their views on me. That is not a disagreement about science, but about politics and power.
