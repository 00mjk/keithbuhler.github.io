### So You're in Philosophy
Most people that don't go to college will never study philosophy. Most people that go to college will take one philosophy class: introduction to philosophy. [Make the most of it. I can help.](/philosophy)

### The Next Step

Depending on the professor, most people find philosophy surprisingly interesting. A percentage of people will take some more philosophy classes. A few will earn a major or minor. Should you? The short answer is: maybe. [Studying philosophy is a very good idea](/philosophy-major)
It helps you to find a good job, earn a higher salary than a business degree, become fully human, and find answers to life's deepest questions.
