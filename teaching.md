# Teaching 

<img src="/img/measurelearning.png" alt="propermeasure" align="right" hspace="20" height="300" width="300">

I have been teaching full time in universities or classical high schools for more than 8 years. 

At the Universty of Kentucky and Asbury University, I've taught metaphysics, ethics, bioethics, and philosophy of religion courses. Before that, I served one year as Director of High School Studies at a classical school, and two years as Master Tutor at Torrey Academy where I both taught and designed courses in humanities, Great Books, and western civilization. Students enjoy my enthusiasm for the subject and personable approach to classroom discussion.  

### Teaching Statement
