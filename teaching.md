Before teaching at university, I taught high school for many years. You can see a complete list of classes on my [CV](/Buhler-CV.pdf). I have served as a Master Tutor and a Director of High School Studies at two different schools, where I created curricula and helped train teachers. 

At universities, I have taught seven distinct preps. The courses and sample syllabi are:

### Course Syllabi
F2016 Business Ethics (coming soon)  
F2016 Philosophy of CS Lewis (coming soon)  
S2016 Wisdom and Virtue  ([Syllabus](/PHL293))  
S2016 Health Care Ethics ([Syllabus](/PHI305))    
F2015 Health Care Ethics ([Syllabus](/PHI305))       
S2015 Introduction to Philosophy ([Syllabus](/PHL200))   
F2014 Introduction to Philosophy ([Syllabus](/PHL200))    
F2013 Introduction to Ethics ([Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u2FI836N6FcWWs2I5BrbLF1tQav9wjcDJiOU0bRkfRw/edit))     
S2013 Introduction to Logic (coming soon)

### Teaching Statement (in progress)

My teaching is Socratic and inspirational. "Socratic" because I engage students to give an account of their thoughts by asking them tough questions. "Inspirational" because I also provide them a vision of how big ideas can alter one's life. These two methods together produce results: group discussions make space for students to grow as independent reasoners, while lectures present rigorous, exciting, and challenging ideas.

Serious interest in philosophy is more caught than taught. In a proper learning environment, students of all aptitudes, backgrounds, and career ambitions will not just enjoy their philosophy class but “catch” an interest in philosophical learning. They will “catch” the excitement of self-reflection, the challenge of thinking clearly, and will forge new friendships with fellow learners. 

Creating a proper environment for such interest is a two-way activity. For example, the #1 student priority is that teachers make learning enjoyable;  the #1 one teacher priority is that students take responsibility for their own learning. This difference of priorities creates tension that can be a liability or an asset. 

My job is to turn that tension into an asset. The first day, as we go over the syllabus,  I assure my students I will do my part to make the class enjoyable and challenging and rewarding. I ask them very clearly to do their part, to take responsibility for their own learning. By college, students may not be psychologically and neuro-physiologically mature but they are legal and emotional adults.  My high expectations of them elicit high performance.

**Introductory classes:** Introductory classes require a careful strategy. 
These classes should show students of varying backgrounds, abilities, and ambitions -- both men and women -- the potential benefits of a philosophy major. These classes should give each student at least a small taste of the joy of working hard in a group to understand and critique big ideas. My introductory classes are 2/3 lecture (usually with a slideshow, made available before class), and 1/3 discussion, because the studies show that discussion increase his retention by almost 50%.[^1] Even so, lectures are interactive, with a 40/10 ratio of minutes spent lecturing and minutes spent in Q&A. Class discussions should accustom students to normal aporetic feelings of impatience, vertigo, and confusion and equip them to work through these feelings into confidence, diligence, and genuine insight. 

**Upper division classes**: These classes should show students the potential benefits of a philosophy minor, (including statistically higher salary in their chosen field relative to non-philosophy minor counterparts, developing master skills such as teamwork, creativity, problem-solving, sharp reading comprehension, and excellent persuasive writing). These classes give each student a full and satisfying experience of thinking deeply about life-altering topics in groups. Class time is 1/3 lecture and 2/3 discussion, including student-lead presentations or discussion starters. Discussions should allow students to develop the "mental muscle" of leading their own learning, initiating questions, cutting of tangents, and practicing co-operative dialogue. 

Upper division classes coursework exposes students to equal parts primary and excellent secondary sources (from an Oxford Handbook or other like textbook). I give students background before encouraging competency in the state–of-the-discipline conversations in the relevant field (in bioethics, business ethics,  virtue ethics, etc.) Paper assignments allow more play for research outside of class texts, and follow the traditional philosophy paper format, including introduction and conclusion. Students are graded primarily (60%) on participation and papers, with a smaller portion (40%) of the grade reserved for reading quizzes and tests.
