Over the last four years, I have taught eight courses at the University of Kentucky and at Asbury University:

I have been teaching at the high school or college level for fifteen years. In secondary schools, I served as Master Tutor for two years and Director of High School Studies for one year. You can see a complete list of courses taught on my [CV](/Buhler-CV.pdf).

### Teaching Statement (in progress)

My goal in teaching is to build an immersive environment of rigorous philosophical thinking in which students can grow intellectually. From the first day, I invite students to think about new ideas in new ways. I understand that taking the invitation is a risk. So I give them the space, the tools, the inspiration and they need to take that risk. 

In my experience, creating a proper environment for such interest is a two-way activity: On my first day, I promise to make the course as enjoyable as possible and ask students to take responsibility for their own learning. My high expectations elicit high performance. Clear expectations give them the best chance of being invigorated by philosophical arguments and becoming self-motivated to read, write, and discuss. Furthermore, by getting to know students and listening to them, I earn their respect. One student said: “He learned our names very quickly and took time to understand our points in discussion.” (PHI305, 2015) 

### Strategies

I approach introductory classes a bit differently than upper division classes or seminars. For example, 100+ level classes allow young men and women of a variety of backgrounds and aptitudes to discover the potential benefits of a philosophy major, since these students may not have firm plans.

In introductory classes, class time is 2/3rds interactive lecture, with Google Slideshows available before and during class. The remaining 1/3rd of classtime is teacher-lead discussion that accustoms students to the normal aporetic feelings of confusion and vertigo that come from doing hard philosophical work, and encourages them to press on to genuine insight. Materials are mainly historical primary sources, such as Plato, Augustine, and Hume, and I coach them on reading well, comprehending, and questioning the texts. We also discuss films like the Matrix, Toy Story 3, and Tree of Life. I try to always be mindful that though many students are just "going through the motions", there is always a chance that these classes can permanently alter a person's life for the better. 

200+ level classes should allow students with a variety of majors and career plans to discover the potential benefits of a philosophy minor, including the fact that the creativity and problem-solving skills they learn in philosophy are statistically correlated with a higher salary in many fields. 

In these classes, class time is only 1/3rd interactive lecture, with 2/3rds cooperative discussion or student-lead presentations. Materials still include primary sources but include some excellent secondary sources, such Oxford Handbooks, or monographs from philosophers like Thomas Nagel and Rosalind Hursthouse. 

Students understand and appreciate that assignments are not just for the grade but are geared to philosophical thinking. One student said:  “None of the assignments are busy work." (PHL200, 2014) Philosophical papers follow a disputation format: stating one's view, arguing for that view, stating reasonable objections, and responding to objections. 

### Results

Students consistently report enjoying my classes: Over four years, I've earned average scores of 3.5 (out of 4) overall course quality and 3.7 overall in teaching quality. I also tend to recruit about 2 out of every 30 students to a philosophy major or minor. One student did not think of herself as a "philosopher," but after a course on virtue ethics, she realized that studying music was not employing her gift for philosophy, so she switched majors. 

Each component of my teaching strategy is being slowly improved. For example, my first year of teaching, I required everyone to speak in class to earn participation points. Students complained that the class was "geared toward external processors" so I changed this requirement. Now my participation points are assessed by both verbal participation in class and written discussion online after class. This allows talkative students extra time to speak without punishing quieter students who need time to process. One student said: "I am more of a internal processor so at first the class seemed intimidating to me, but as time went on it was not as bad and I enjoyed that internal processors had other options as well." (PHI100, 2015)

Although classroom discussions can be slow and difficult, they are often rewarding. One student said: "I was really surprised that readings, lectures and discussions could change the opinion of my stubborn self." (PHI305, 2015) The positive effect of co-operative discussion has real-world benefits as well: One business major said that the  philosophical dialogue skills he learned saved his relationship with his significant other, with whom he did not know how to disagree and converse. 

Students consistently report that writing disputation papers is their favorite part of class because they had to learn their opponent's view. For example, one medical ethics student wrote: "I loved writing the papers. It helped me look past the surface and see my true position on each subject/topic." (PHL200 2015) 


### Conclusion

My teaching strategy is focused on finding creative ways to elicit student participation in an immersive philosophical dialogue. While dialogue is challenging, I aim to provide the encouragement that inspires students to grow. A warm and friendly enviroment of inclusivity, respect, and personal responsibility allows each student to maximize their own learning in a safe space. Every component, from reading, to writing, to discussion, opens their eyes to a new way of thinking and invites them to continue growing, either by studying more philosophy or by studying their chosen speciality more philosophically.
