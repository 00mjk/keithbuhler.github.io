#### Student Feedback Highlights ####

* "Buhler is very theatrical about philosophy which is great."
* "He treats us like adults and enjoys discussion."
* "None of his assignments are busy work."
* "He learned our names very quickly and took time to understand our points in discussion." 
* "The papers and midterm were effective and helpful with understanding the material for the class."
*  "I was really blessed by you and your passion in your teaching method. You have challenged me and helped me grow as person."
*  "I was really surprised that readings, lectures and discussions could change the opinion of my stubborn self."
*  "While the readings were arguing for one side, the [disputation paper] format made it easier to see the other side..."
*  "I really enjoyed the class discussions, I am not a talker, but I love listening to others opinions and seeing issues from a different point of view I may not have seen previously."
*  "This class has taught me that there are very different opinions on almost every single controversial issue.  It is sometimes hard to respect the other side, but as I have learned this semester, you may not always agree but you have to respect it.  I have also learned that voicing your opinion is never a bad thing.  
*  "Before the class, I was very uncomfortable talking about controversial issues because I did not like to debate or disagree with other opinions in the room. I have learned that the debate can the most interesting part."
*  "I can say that I learned more from this class than any I have taken before."
