I've successfully helped learners of all ages to grow and flourish. Students enjoy my enthusiasm for the subject, affable presence, and  theatrical approach to classroom discussion. My goal in teaching is to build an friendly environment of immersive Socratic dialogue that empowers students to grow intellectually.
