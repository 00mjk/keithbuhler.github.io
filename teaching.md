### **Discursive Student Evaluations**
* "Buhler is a fantastic teacher. He is very theatrical about philosophy which is great. He treats us like adults and enjoys discussion. He really brings out the best about philosophy. None of his assignments are busy work. He learned our names very quickly and took time to understand our points in discussion. He is very knowledgeable about many things and has a very open view to discussion."
* "He was very engaged and wanted each of us to be involved in discussions. He challenged us to think deeper and more critically than before. The papers and midterm were effective and helpful with understanding the material for the class. The readings supported all the ideas taught within the class."
 
 
**Unsolicited Comments from Students**
* "I just wanted to say thank you for a great semester! I really enjoyed your class and teaching style, and I can honestly say I took a lot from the material you taught us."
