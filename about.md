Hi, I'm Keith Buhler, a philosopher, classical teacher, and writer from Los Angeles. Thanks for visiting.  

As of fall 2017, I've taken a position teaching History, Writing, and Greek at a classical Christian school in LA. 

I've been teaching philosophy and liberal arts since 2001, including two years as Master Tutor at Torrey Academy (La Mirada, CA), a semester long postdoc at the University of Kentucky, and three years as philosophy instructor at Asbury University. As an educator, I use humor, inspiring lectures, and hard questions to create a learning atmosphere that motivates and invigorates students of all ages to reflect on Great Books, film, music, and their own lives.

I also have several years of leadership and administrative experience in classical schools, serving as High School Director at Veritas Christian Academy (Lexington, KY) and Assistant Director at Wheatstone Academy (La Habra, CA). We build [programs that are truly classical](http://www.keithbuhler.com//classical-education/): fully engaged in primary sources, digging into the big ideas that have occupied the western imagination, and in zealous pursuit of virtue and wisdom. 

In 2017, I completed my [Ph.D.](/phd) in Philosophy under [David Bradshaw](https://uky.academia.edu/DBradshaw). I also hold an M.A. in Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand and a B.A. in Humanities from Biola University.  

Outside of the classroom, I am a devout amateur. I believe it is important to create things for the love of it: For example, I self-published a [Platonic dialog](http://bitly.com/ScriptureOrTradition) about Scripture and Tradition, and have written or co-written four feature-length screenplays (none produced -- yet!). I enjoy creating art with unusual media like silly putty, snow, sand, and pumpkins, and I also write poetry, draw, paint, sculpt, act, MC, sing tenor and create the occasional website. 

I am happily married to one of the world's few remaining Perfect Women, with whom I have two children who are Not Yet Perfect. Put together, they make life a raucous good time.
