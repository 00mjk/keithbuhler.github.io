Thanks for visiting.  I am currently a postdoc at the University of Kentucky and an instructor of philosophy at Asbury University. 

My wife and I both hail from Southern California, so this is our first time living out of the country.  We're also raising two toddlers, which makes one realize the value of sleep. (However, they also have a way of motivating one to do well on the job market.)

For me, academic philosophy is a discipline and a profession. And it is a way of flourishing in community. 

I always enjoyed school growing up but my life was altered in college. Studying history, literature, and philosophy at the Torrey Honors Institute felt like touching a live wire. I was hooked. 

As a sophomore, I started bringing others along. I taught "great books" to 4th grade public school students in Long Beach CA, and have continued teaching students of all ages to this day. 

Even after teaching and researching philosophy all week, I preside over my local chapter of the American Chesterton Society to discuss literature, film, and politics with friends.

People sometimes wonder what a philosopher *does*. Most of the time I read and think through tough arguments about a variety of topics. When I have an objection or a thesis of my own, I present them to students, colleagues, or advisors or  write out an argument, and the dialogue continues. I also teach university courses and invite people to pursue wisdom with me.

In my 45 minutes per month of spare time, I like to draw things like the picture above and sculpt clay. I also write fiction, screenplays, and [lists of what I do in my spare time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)
