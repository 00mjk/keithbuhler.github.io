I'm an academic [philosopher](/) and classical [educator.](/teaching) I do some speaking and writing as well.  Philosophy is for me an academic discipline and part of human flourishing in community.

I've had the privilege of serving as a [teacher](/teaching) in universities classical high schools for 8+ years and love what I do. I use real books, immersive Socratic dialogue, and humor to [introduce folks](/students) to the great conversation. 

The [dissertation](/research) centers on the neo-Aristotelian account of nature and normativity. It's almost done. When Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre all weigh in on the relation between human nature and human virtue, facts and values, science and ethics -- I mostly defend Foot.   

In my spare time (about 45 minutes per month), I like creating [art](/art), editing Wikipedia, writing fiction, and [composing lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) of what I do in my spare time.
