I am a philosopher, classical teacher, and writer living in Los Angeles. I am currently finishing up as postdoctoral scholar of philosophy at the University of Kentucky. In the fall, I will be teaching history, theology, and Greek at Trinity Classical Academy. My primary academic research interests are in virtue ethics, naturalism, and philosophy of religion.

I have been Master Tutor at Torrey Academy in La Mirada, CA, Director of High School Studies at Veritas Academy in Lexington, KY, and instructor of philosophy at Asbury University. My teaching method uses the lost tools of learning to inspire and awaken students to the pursuit of wisdom.  by analyzing great books, films, music, and their own lives. 

I am also a devout amateur and advocate for doing things yourself. I write screenplays, short stories, poetry, paint, sculpt clay, make silly putty, carve pumpkins, draw, sing tenor, beat box, and create websites. 

I completed my PhD in philosophy under the direction of [David Bradshaw](https://uky.academia.edu/DBradshaw). I also hold an M.A. in Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand, and a B.A. in Humanities from Biola University.
