Hi, I'm Keith Buhler, a philosopher, classical teacher, and writer from Los Angeles. Thanks for visiting.  

I'm currently teaching History, Writing, and Greek at a classical Christian school in LA. Before that, I held a teaching postdoc at the University of Kentucky and was a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. 

I've been a teacher for more than 10 years now, teaching a variety of subjects in ages 9th-12th grade, college, and adults. I've served as Master Tutor at the Torrey Academy, Assistant Director at Wheatstone Academy, and High School Director at the Veritas Christian Academy. 

As an educator, I use humor and Socratic dialog to create a friendly and challenging learning atmosphere. Then inspiring lectures, high expectations, and hard questions motivate and invigorate students to reflect on Great Books, film, music, and their own lives.

My experience with classical education began at the Torrey Honors Institute at Biola University. I began teaching in 2001, leading Socratic discussions about fairy tales with 4th grade GATE students in Long Beach, CA. I help build [programs that are truly classical](http://www.keithbuhler.com/classical-education/): fully engaged in primary sources, digging into the big ideas that have occupied the western imagination, and in zealous pursuit of virtue and wisdom. 

In 2017, I completed my [Ph.D.](/phd) in Philosophy under [David Bradshaw](https://uky.academia.edu/DBradshaw). I also hold an M.A. in Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand and a B.A. in Humanities from Biola University.  

Outside of the classroom, I am a devout amateur. I believe it is important to create things for the love of it: For example, I self-published a [Platonic dialog](http://bitly.com/ScriptureOrTradition) about Scripture and Tradition, and have written or co-written four feature-length screenplays (none produced -- yet!). I enjoy creating art with unusual media like silly putty, snow, sand, and pumpkins, and I also write poetry, draw, paint, sculpt, act, MC, sing tenor and create the occasional website. 

I am happily married to one of the world's few Perfect Women, with whom I have two children who are Not Yet Perfect. Put together, they make life a raucous good time.
