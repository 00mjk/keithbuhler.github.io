Thanks for visiting.  I am currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Kentucky and part-time instructor of philosophy at Asbury University. 

My wife and I both hail from Southern California, so this is our first time living out of the country. 

We're also raising two toddlers, which makes realize the value of sleep. However, they also have a way of motivating one to finish graduate school: I am on track to  go on the job market in 2016.

For me, academic philosophy is a discipline and a profession. And it is a way of flourishing in community. I always enjoyed school growing up but my life was altered in college. Studying history, literature, and philosophy at the Torrey Honors Institute felt like touching a live wire. As a sophomore, I began teaching "great books" to 4th grade public school students in Long Beach CA, and have continued teaching students of all ages to this day. Even after teaching and researching philosophy all week, I host a weekly book club at my home to discuss literature, film, and politics with friends.

People often wonder what a philosopher *does*. Most of the time I read and think through tough arguments about a variety of topics. When I have an objection or a thesis of my own, I present them to students, colleagues, or advisors or  write out an argument, and the dialogue continues. I also teach university courses and invite people to pursue wisdom with me.


In my 45 minutes per month of spare time, I like to sculpt clay, to write fiction and screenplays, and [compose lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) of what I do in my spare time.
