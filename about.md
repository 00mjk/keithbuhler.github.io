Thanks for visiting. I'm a husband and father 24/7. My two kiddos are 3 and 1 (as of 14 July 2016). My wife is my [Davy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Severe_Mercy)

During the 9-5, I'm a [philosopher](/) and classical [educator.](/teaching) I do some speaking and [writing](http://www.amazon.com/Sola-Scriptura-Dialogue-Keith-Buhler-ebook/dp/B009N27L12/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1401301911&sr=8-9&keywords=sola+scriptura) as well.  My goal is to contribute to academic philosophy and also journey toward human flourishing with my friends, colleagues, and students. 

I've had the privilege of serving as a [teacher](/teaching) in universities classical high schools for 8+ years and love what I do. I use real books, immersive Socratic dialogue, and humor to [introduce folks](/students) to the great conversation. 

This dissertation is just about done. My [research](/research) centers on the neo-Aristotelian account of nature and normativity. When Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre all weigh in on the relation between human nature and human virtue, facts and values, science and ethics -- I mostly defend Foot.   

In my 45 minutes per month of spare time, I like creating [art](/art), editing Wikipedia, writing fiction, and [composing lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) of what I do in my spare time.
