Thanks for visiting.  I am currently a PhD candidate at the [University of Kentucky.](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226) My wife and I both hail from Southern California, so this is our first time living out of the country. 

We are raising two toddlers, which can be messy. However, they motivate me finish  graduate school: I am on track to finish up in 2016 and go on the job market. 

People often wonder what a philosopher *does*. Most of the time I read tough arguments and think them through. When I have an objection or a thesis of my own, I present them to students, colleagues, or advisors or  write out an argument, and the dialogue continues.

For me, philosophy is a discipline, a profession, and an important part of academia. It is also a way of flourishing in community. I always enjoyed school growing up but my life was altered in college. Studying history, literature, and philosophy at the Torrey Honors Institute felt like touching a live wire. While still a student in college, I started to give back, teaching 4th grade "Great Books" in Long Beach CA. Since then, I've taught students of almost every age and love of what I do. Even after teaching and researching philosophy all week, I host a weekly book club at my home to discuss literature, film, and politics with friends.

In my 45 minutes per month of spare time, I like to sculpt clay, to write fiction and screenplays, and [compose lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) of what I do in my spare time.
