Thanks for visiting. 

I'm Keith Buhler, a philosopher and classical educator currently residing and working in Kentucky. My wife and I both hail from Southern California, so this is our first time living out of the country.  

We're also raising two toddlers, which makes one realize the value of sleep. (However, they also have a way of motivating one to do well on the job market.)

For me, philosophy is a profession and way of life. I discovered philosophy, history, literature, and big ideas in college. Reading primary sources at the Torrey Honors Institute felt like touching a live wire. 

By the time I was a sophomore, I was already teaching "junior great books" with gift 4th graders at a public school in Long Beach CA. I never stopped. 

Currently, I teach at two universities. I'm working on a few publications as well as blogging.

Even after teaching and researching philosophy all week, I preside over my local chapter of the American Chesterton Society to discuss literature, film, and politics with friends.

In my 45 minutes per month of spare time, I like to draw things like the picture above and sculpt clay. I also write fiction, screenplays, and [lists of what I do in my spare time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)
