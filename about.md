He currently holds teaches History, Greek Language, and Bible at a classical school in CA. Before that, he was a philosophy instructor at Asbury University and post-doc at the University of Kentucky. 

Buhler aims to invite everyone to pursue wisdom through humility. He uses dialog to ask hard questions about Great Books, history, and life itself, including high culture and pop culture. 

Buhler has written two books: the first was a self-published [Platonic dialogue](http://bitly.com/ScriptureOrTradition) about Scripture and Tradition. 

The second, a philosophy dissertation in contemporary analytic virtue ethics titled [Becoming What We Are](/phd). 

His writings on classical education have been published in Wheatstone Academy's *The Examined Life*, the *Word* magazine, MereOrthodoxy.com among others. 

He completed a [Ph.D.](/phd) in Philosophy under [David Bradshaw](https://uky.academia.edu/DBradshaw) and also holds an M.A. in Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand and a B.A. in Humanities from Biola University.  

He is happily married to one of the world's Perfect Women and has three children -- but no dogs or cats. In his 20 minutes of spare time per month, Buhler is a devout amateur who believes in creating for the sake of art, rather than return. He writes screenplays, poetry, and fiction, in addition to drawing, painting, sculpting, and singing tenor.
