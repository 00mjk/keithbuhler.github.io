Thanks for visiting. 

My life was altered by studying history, literature, and philosophy at the Torrey Honors Institute. While still a student in college, I started to give back, teaching 4th grade "Great Books" in Long Beach CA. Since then, I've taught students of almost every age and love of what I do.

I am currently a PhD candidate at the [University of Kentucky.](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226) My wife and I both hail from Southern California, so this is our first time living out of the country. 

We are raising two toddlers, which can be messy. However, they motivate me finish  graduate school: I am on track to finish up in 2016 and go on the job market. 

People often wonder what a philosopher *does*. Most of the time I read tough arguments and think them through. When I have an objection or a thesis of my own, I present them to students, colleagues, or advisors. Eventually, I write out an argument, someone reads it, the dialogue continues.

For me, philosophy is a discipline and a way of flourishing individually and in community. After teaching and researching philosophy all week, we host a weekly book club where we discuss literature, film, and politics.  

In my 45 minutes per month of spare time, I like to play ping pong, sculpt clay, and write fiction or screenplays (none produced yet!).  I also like to [compose lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) of what I do in my spare time.
