Thanks for visiting. During the 9-5, I'm an academic [philosopher](/) and classical [educator.](/teaching) I do some speaking and [writing](http://www.amazon.com/Sola-Scriptura-Dialogue-Keith-Buhler-ebook/dp/B009N27L12/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1401301911&sr=8-9&keywords=sola+scriptura) as well.  My career goals are not only to contribute to this wonderful discipline but also to journey toward human flourishing with my friends, colleagues, and students. 

I've had the privilege of serving as a [teacher](/teaching) in universities classical high schools for 8+ years and love what I do. I use real books, immersive Socratic dialogue, and humor to [introduce folks](/students) to the great conversation. 

The dissertation phase is challenging but actually kind of enjoyable. I'm almost finished. The [dissertation](/research) centers on the neo-Aristotelian account of nature and normativity. When Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre all weigh in on the relation between human nature and human virtue, facts and values, science and ethics -- I mostly defend Foot.   

Every morning I wake up grateful to be married to the woman of my dreams; we are raising two kiddos together (ages 3 and 1 as of 14 July 2016). 

In my 45 minutes per month of spare time, I like creating [art](/art), editing Wikipedia, writing fiction, and [composing lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) of what I do in my spare time.
