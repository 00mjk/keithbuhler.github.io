Thanks for visiting. I am currently a PhD candidate at the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226) and an adjunct philosophy instructor at Asbury University. 

My wife and I both hail from Southern California, so going to school in Kentucky is our first time living out of the country. 

We are also raising two toddlers, which is a  messy experience. However, they do have a way of motivating one to move quickly through graduate school. My dissertation centers on contemporary analytic virtue ethics. I am on track to finish up in 2016 and go on the job market. 

For me, philosophy is a discipline and a way of flourishing individually and in community. My life was forever altered by attending the Torrey Honors Institute where we spent thousands of hours in discussion of the best books, music, art, and thoughts humans have produced. 

While still a student in college, I started to give back: I taught 4th graders the "Junior Great Books" at a GATE program in Long Beach. Since then, I've taught adults, high schoolers, and college students philosophy, history, literature, poetry, theology, Spanish, and art. I was Master Tutor for 2 years at the Torrey Academy and Director of High School Studies at Veritas Academy for 1 year. 

In my 45 minutes per month of spare time, I like to draw, sculpt, write screenplays, and [compose lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) of what I do in my spare time. My art is mostly for myself and friends. I've written several feature length screenplays (none produced yet!) and self-published a book-length Platonic dialogue.
