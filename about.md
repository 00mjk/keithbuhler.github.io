I'm Keith Buhler, a philosopher, classical teacher, and writer from Los Angeles. As of fall 2017, I'll be teaching History, Writing, and Greek at a classical Christian school in LA. My primary academic research interests are in virtue ethics, naturalism, and philosophy of religion. 

I've been teaching philosophy and liberal arts since 2001, including two years as Master Tutor at Torrey Academy (La Mirada, CA), a semester long postdoc at the University of Kentucky, and three years as philosophy instructor at Asbury University. As an educator, I use humor, inspiring lectures, and hard questions to create a learning atmosphere that motivates and invigorates students of all ages. I awaken students to the lost tools of learning by examining the Great Books, and invite them to use the same tools to reflect on film, music, and their own lives.

I also have severals leadership and administrative experience in classical schools, serving as High School Director at Veritas Christian Academy (Lexington, KY) and Assistant Director at Wheatstone Academy (La Habra, CA). We build [programs that are truly classical](http://www.keithbuhler.com//classical-education/): fully engaged in primary sources, digging into the big ideas that have occupied the western imagination, and in zealous pursuit of virtue and wisdom. 

In 2017, I completed my [Ph.D.](/phd) in Philosophy under [David Bradshaw](https://uky.academia.edu/DBradshaw). I also hold an M.A. in Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand and a B.A. in Humanities from Biola University.  

Outside of the classroom, I am a devout amateur artist. I believe it is important to create things for the love of it. I self-published a [Platonic dialog](http://bitly.com/ScriptureOrTradition) about Scripture and Tradition, and have written four feature-length screenplays. I like to write poetry, draw, paint,  sculpt, act, MC, and sing tenor. I enjoy creating art with unusual media like silly putty, snow, and pumpkins. As of 2016, I've been learning how to create the occasional website.  Thanks for visiting.
