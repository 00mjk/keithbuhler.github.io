Thanks for visiting.  My wife and I both hail from Southern California, so this is our first time living out of the country.  We're also raising two toddlers, which makes one realize the value of sleep. (However, they also have a way of motivating one to do well on the job market.)

For me, philosophy is an academic profession and a way of life. I got hooked on thinking deeply about history, literature, and ideas in college at the Torrey Honors Institute. It felt like touching a live wire. 

I started teaching right away, discussing "junior great books" with gift 4th graders at a public school in Long Beach CA. Now, I teach at two universities. Even after teaching and researching philosophy all week, I preside over my local chapter of the American Chesterton Society to discuss literature, film, and politics with friends.

In my 45 minutes per month of spare time, I like to draw things like the picture above and sculpt clay. I also write fiction, screenplays, and [lists of what I do in my spare time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)
