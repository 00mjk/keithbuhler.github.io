Do you need an academic website? [Hire me!](emailto:info@keithbuhler.com)

## Cost

There is a low initial one-time cost of $100, and a monthly maintenance cost of $5. 

You can also pay me $100 for a brand new site set up and design using Weebly or Wix, where you pay them the maintenance cost and do it yourself. 


## Design

Design can be done one of three ways. 

The first is to pick one of these seven themes.  Here are some clean, beautiful sites for you to choose from. 

1. [Sample 1](/) -- my website -- this website! 4 pages=about, cv, teaching, research, optional page for student resources.
2. [Sample 2](/sample2) -- Continuous scroll -- beautiful full page image splash.  
3. [Sample 3](/sample3) -- Hyde -- a brazen left navigation column with right column content. 
4. [Sample 4](/sample4) -- Twenty
4. [Sample 5](/sample5) -- Mediator 
5. [Sample 6](/sample6) -- Left
6. [Sample 7](/sample7) -- Scribble
