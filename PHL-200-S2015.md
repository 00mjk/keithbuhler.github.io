# Syllabus, Spring 2015 #
**Introduction to Philosophy: “Goodness, Truth, and Beauty”**
**Instructor**: Keith Buhler  
**Email**: [keith.buhler@uky.edu](emailto:keith.buhler@uky.edu)  
**Twitter**: [@keith_buhler](http://www.twitter.com/keith_buhler)    
**Office Hours:** Tues/Thurs, 12-1pm @ Kinlaw by C. S. Lewis.


## Course Overview: 
This class is an exercise in a different way of thinking. We will think about things like death, the soul, knowledge, and God in a deeper way. You may be confused. You will be challenged. 

We will learn facts and concepts and words, but the main task will be to stretch our minds together. We will learn history, theology, philosophy, ethics, but the main task is to think as a group. We will practice writing, discussing, analyzing, memorizing -- but thinking clearly, logically, accurately is the master skill. 

Reading well, thinking well, writing well are skills you can use in any profession: in motherhood, the marketplace, or the monastery. These skills will benefit you professionally. The top five most coveted job skills — no matter what your career — are communication, teamwork, critical thinking, and creativity, and self-discipline. And in this class you will practice just those skills. 

For some, this class will convince you to major or minor in philosophy.  For others, it will help you form a critical approach to your own discipline. 

For all of us, we want to become more connected, integrated, thoughtful, reflective human beings.  The ultimate motivation for having the conversation we call philosophy must be that it can make us better. We are also entering into the Great Conversation with our own, limited (often confused) thoughts, becoming part of the Conversation, and (by it) being forever changed. 

**Our goals then are:**

* To understand major philosophical questions, figures, and theories (such as platonism, empiricism)
* To read and reconstruct arguments in philosophical texts, including historical texts (Apology, Confessions, Treatise on Human Nature)
* To use analytical and abstract thinking skills to evaluate arguments and philosophical theories
* To explore the bearing that the Christian faith, on the one hand, and alternative worldviews such as naturalism and deism, on the other, have on questions about the meaning of life and the content and grounds of morality.
* to reflect upon our own lives, beliefs, attitudes, culture, and goals 
to become more thoughtful, alert human beings, in pursuit of goodness, truth, and beauty

##Scope and Sequence:
To accomplish these goals, this 16-week course is divided into into 10 units of 1-2 weeks each, plus one Introductory Unit on philosophy.  

Each unit consists of some of our four components: (a) readings (b) participation in interactive lectures and discussion, (c) written tests, and (d) disputation paper. 

## Grading:
The class work consists of four components: reading, participating, testing, and writing. You will be graded equally on each component, plus applicable extra credit.


|  Assessment category  |  Percent of semester grade |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Readings (Quiz/reports) |         20%   |  
| Participation (Talking, writing) |   25% |
| Tests (Midterm, Final)         |  25% |
| Disputation Papers (6 papers, pass/fail) |  25% |
| Extra Credit | 3% (max)|

I typically do not round up. So 89.5 is a “B”
A  = 99%-93%       A- = 90%-92%   
B+ = 87%-89%      B  = 83% - 86%         
B-  = 80% - 82%    C+ = 77%-79%
C   = 73% - 76%     C-  = 70% -72%
D  = 69% - 60%     F  < 59%  

## Reading (Quizzes & Self-Reports)
The primary work if this class will be reading — and trying to understand — these books. 

- Jostein Gaarder, Sophie’s World           ISBN: 0374530718
- Plato, Last Days of Socrates (Apology, Phaedo)     ISBN: 0140449280
- Augustine, Confessions              ISBN: 0199537828
- Hume: Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding:      ISBN: 002353110X  (Not “Treatise”)

Use these ISBNS only, please. (New or used is fine.) Use hard copies please; they are better for notes, and make it easier to stay on the same page in class and when assigning pages. 

I am requiring real books. This is harder but more interesting than a textbook. You’ll be reading about 3 hours a week. Read well. Read every assignment entirely. Skimming is sometimes necessary, but don’t skim every week.

### Quizzes
A short reading quiz is due almost every class day. These assess whether you read, and how well. They are mandatory and graded. You have 10 minutes for each quiz, and they are due at the beginning of class. The goal is to give you a few questions that you can easily answer if you did the reading. Also there is a self-report question, where you can tell me whether you finished the reading or not, and how much you got to. 

### Reading Tips
- Read ahead. 
- Give yourself enough time to read carefully. You will get better and faster. 
- Try to understand the book. What is the author’s key terms? The author’s main point? 
- Dialogue with the book before class. Take notes. Email me. Talk with each other. Talk with other friends. Process your thoughts. 
- Take notes on: Is the author correct? What confused you? What questions did you have? What does the book mean?
- The two most important questions for each reading 1. What is the main truth claim? 2. What is the evidence?
- Pay attention to what confuses you and what you disagree with. Bring your questions to class.
- Don’t read the introduction for the book (which is often more confusing than the book). If you do want to read it, read it after reading the primary source — that may help. 
- Use things like Sparknotes sparingly. I want you to have your own encounter with the text. Get your own first impression. Sparknotes can pretty useful but don’t rely on it and only read it after reading the primary source.

##Participation:
To get the most out of this class, you must take responsibility for your own participation. I may not call on you. I may not know what you need. I cannot read your mind. But if you take responsibility, you can learn a lot, change, and grow. 

Participation in this class takes two forms: discussing (external processing) and writing (internal processing). Everyone will participate in these two ways. But you get to pick your emphasis. Are you an internal or external processor? 

Everyone will write and everyone will talk. But there are two “tracks” or emphases.

*Writing Emphasis:* If you want to emphasize writing, to earn participation points, you will email me class reflections each week. You may elect to speak in class as well, and may be called upon. But your primary participation will be written.  You will forego the end of semester synthesis paper. 
Email after class once a week.   Meet at end of semester. 

*Speaking Emphasis:* If you want to emphasize talking, you will be on my “go to” team to talk in class (instead of emailing reflections after class). You also have to visit office hours to continue the conversation. At the end of the semester, you will turn in one synthesis paper reflecting on a major theme from the class, and how thinking about it has affected your worldview and your life. 

Talk in class once a week.    Write at end of semester. 

##Attendance:
We need you here! Attendance is mandatory. You are paying for this education including this class, so why wouldn’t you make the most of it?  Repeated absences (more than 6) will count heavily against your participation grade. 

Roll will be taken each class. (Being late, repeatedly or egregiously late, will count as an absence.)

1 to 6 unexcused absences are freebies — no credit lost. 7 or more unexcused absences cause bigger and bigger deductions from your participation grade. (8 is a letter grade)



## Discussion:
Every day will be interactive, but on Thursdays, we will focus on discussing. The goal of discussion is to learn together, which requires you showing up, (a) you talking, (b) saying what you actually think, and (c) being willing to be challenged, to reconsider, to imagine different possibilities, to change your mind, to defend your view. 

Each of us has a “growth zone” in between our “comfort zone” and our “panic zone.” That growth zone is sometimes called a challenge, learning, stretching zone. Each of us is either comfortable with all three (showing up, speaking your mind, being challenged), or just the first two (showing up and speaking your mind) or with just showing up and listening. So each of us has to focus on getting out of our comfort zone, without panicking! If you are comfortable just listening, challenge yourself to speak. If you are comfortable speaking, challenge yourself to speak your mind, to be vulnerable. If you are comfortable speaking your mind, be open to having what you say challenged. (If you are already comfortable being challenged, your growth zone will be to challenge others!)

You will grow as a person if you engage in discussion. These are not only necessary for doing philosophy, but they happen to be hirable skills.

## Tests: 
There are two exams: midterm and final. These exams will assess your knowledge of historical facts, philosophical definitions, and the ability to synthesize and apply concepts. The study guides with all questions are provided ahead of time for you to fill in and study with. 

## Philosophical Disputation Papers: 

Every 2 weeks or so, you will write a 400+ word disputation. Each disputation is pass/fail and worth approximately 5% of the semester grade. The instructions for these assignments are on Discovery.

## Extra Credit?
For those who may need or desire to do extra credit, there are three opportunities for extra credit. Instructions are available on Discovery. 

##ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Academic integrity, the embodiment of the moral and spiritual principles to which we adhere, is the essential basis of the Asbury University academic community. Integrity, as partially defined by the Student or Program Handbook on Community Life Expectations, is “both knowing the right thing to do and doing it regardless of the circumstances.” This definition may be applied to all of the scholastic interactions of the academic community. Every member of the community shares responsibility for maintaining mutual trust, respect, and integrity. Violations of such trust and specific acts of academic dishonesty will be subject to disciplinary action.
Definitions
Academic dishonesty can be defined as any type of cheating relative to a formal academic requirement. Academic dishonesty is typically thought of first as plagiarism. Plagiarism, whether intentionally or unintentionally, occurs when credit is taken for what someone else worked hard to discover and record if there is no clarification from where or from whom information is taken. Plagiarism is the use of another’s ideas, words, thoughts, or organization without appropriate credit and documentation when used for a project, paper, presentation, or exam.
More examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to: unauthorized collaborations, fabrications of data, unauthorized access to sources on an exam, excessive revision by someone other than the student, re-use of previous work without permission, and other situations described by faculty for specific purposes.

Determination of Academic Dishonesty and Consequences
Faculty will address suspected occurrences of academic dishonesty as follows:
The faculty member will meet with the student individually to discuss the incident. At the faculty member’s discretion, the department chair will either be notified of the meeting or be asked to be present for it. The student will be informed of the department chair’s involvement.
At the faculty member’s discretion the student will receive a lowered grade, an F or 0% on the assignment in question.
The faculty member will report the incident in writing to the Registrar who will maintain a record of academic integrity violations.
If the incident is the student’s second offense of academic dishonesty as verified by the Registrar, the student will meet with the Dean of the college or school where the most recent incident occurred. At the Dean’s discretion, the student will receive an F in the course.
If the incident is the student’s third offense, the student will be suspended from Asbury University. 

### Appeals Process
Students desiring to appeal a determination of academic dishonesty will follow the ‘Academic Appeals Procedure’ found in the Probation, Suspension, and Appeals section of the Asbury University Bulletin, specifically item 1. A.

## Miscellany
1. Bring the book for the day (on paper or computer), a pen or pencil, to every class.
2. Participate. Participation is your responsibility; I may or may not call on you. Do not distract yourself with side conversations, texting, Facebook, or doing anything else in class. A short mental break every once in a while when you get tired is fine. But come back. 
3. Be respectful. This means paying attention in class to the instructor and your fellow classmates. If you have an important phone call or text, please step outside the class for a moment and return. Show others respect and you will be respected in turn. Listen attentively, don’t make side conversation or say excessive frivolous comments.  Be polite in your emails to me and in your comments to your fellow students. Unkindness, even in the form of jokes and teasing, will not be tolerated. Come to class on time, but don’t leave (nor pack up) before we’re done.  
4. Don’t use electronics. If you ask for permission, I will allow you to use Laptops/iPads on lecture days for note taking. If you need to take a phone call or text, please step outside the room for a moment and come right back.  Otherwise, no phones, laptops, iPhones, or iPads, iPods, smartphones, etc. Unplug, listen and engage.  
5. Communicate. Email me anytime but only between 8am-5pm Monday – Friday, or as I’m available. Include your full name and section number (I teach two sections, so I want to get your identity straight). I’ll try to respond within two business days.   Take advantage of office hours. Call, tweet, or Google Hang Out during office hours or by appointment for any question, big or small, about this course. For short, quick questions, try sending me a direct message on Twitter.  
6. I can accommodate you: If you have a documented disability that might require academic accommodation, please make sure you are registered with the Academic Support Program. Contact Pam Downing (pamela.downing@asbury.edu / (859) 858-3511 x2283.
7. Make up work is not accepted after the due date. It must be submitted within a week of an excused absence, with written consent. Let me know if you are going to be absent for any reason.
9. Enjoy philosophy. We are not merely solving abstract puzzles here, but digging deeply into human thinking in a way that could change your life forever. The more you and your fellows allow yourselves to acquire a “taste” for the material, the more inclined you will be to give it the real effort required to master it.

8. Don’t cheat. Cheating or plagiarism will result in a zero for the assignment. Cite your sources. Unintentional plagiarism is still plagiarism. Egregious instances or repeat instances will result in formal disciplinary action from the university. Also, do not intentionally take anyone else’s work nor provide your work to anyone else (under whatever auspices). A healthy sense of intellectual honor is necessary for succeeding in academics and life. Cheating fundamentally threatens the mission of this institution of higher education. 



##Course Outline*

*(Subject to revisions due to snow days, instructor sickness, academic conferences, etc.)*

Week 01: Origins
T Aug 18 Nothing due: Syllabus Day 
Class preview: This class will be awesome. It’s a lot of reading, so you have to work hard. But more importantly, you have to think hard. Philosophical reflection is new, unfamiliar, challenging. But doing it in community just might be life changing. Today we’ll get to know each other and our expectations. I’ll give you three personal problems philosophy can (maybe) help you with. We’ll also we’ll go over the syllabus to see how this class works, how you can get the grade you want. You’ll learn about our course units, how to read this syllabus (the bold text next to the date is the reading due that day).

R Aug 20 Sophie’s World, Garden of Eden, Top Hat, the Myths, Natural Philosophers, Democritus, and Fate: Time and Cause
Why are my lecture notes included in this course outline? Because students gave consistent feedback that they needed some way to prepare for class, some way to know ahead of time what we would discuss. These notes are part of that solution. The other part is up to students — you have to think. 
In today’s reading, Sophie is asked by a mysterious stranger two key questions: who are you? Where did the world come from? We will do our best to begin answering those questions. Philosophy asks questions about the fundamental reality of us, the cosmos, and what is outside the cosmos. We’ll need two big ideas to answer these questions: time and cause. Devouring time is the condition of our life, and of all material existence. Causes answer the question “why”? We’ll see how these two big ideas help us answer the question. We will also see two big answers. 
Week 02: Truth and Goodness
T Aug 25    Genesis 1-5 and “Free Man’s Worship” Handout:      Mythology   
Today, we assign groups and “internal/external” processors today as well. Then, it’s time to think. 
In its original and technical meaning, a “myth” is not a “false story”.  It is a likely story. Let’s read a familiar text and analyze it afresh. What do we know about God just from Genesis 1-3? What does it mean that man is in the image of God, then?  The goal here is not strictly to exegete, but to think critically. What is the order to the days? What is sin, and by contrast, what redemption? 
Also, let’s compare the mythological cosmology that Bertrand Russell paints in his famous essay “The Free Man’s Worship.” What is the universe like? What is Russell's conception of Freedom? What does he suggest is sin, and redemption? 

R Aug 27 “Truth” and “Goodness” Handouts:    Are truth and goodness objective? 
Today we briefly go over how to do papers. All semester we will be seeking truth. To be successful, we have to know whether truth exists. The belief that knowledge is impossible to discover or express (skepticism) is false. Also the belief that truth doesn’t exist (nihilism) is false. Kreeft gives the best arguments for and against the existence of real truth. Is he right? Also, we are seeking to find goodness (intellectually) and to become good (personally). Kreeft gives the best arguments for and against real goodness. Today we will also go over how to write your first paper. We will also discuss the “Tao” to see examples of universal, common morality. 

Disputation Paper 1 prompt:   Is goodness real or constructed? 
Please carefully review the “Disputation Paper” instructions online. 
Week 03: Socrates I
T Sept 1 Disputation Paper 1: Is goodness real or constructed? (by 11:59pm)

T Sept 1    Plato, Eutyphro; Sophie’s World, Socrates, Athens, Plato:   What is Holiness?
The best way to be introduced to philosophy is to be introduced to Socrates. His character, his style of conversation, his arguments and questions have caused intense reactions for the last 2400 years. How do you react to him? In this dialogue, Socrates has been criminally charged for "impiety.” So practically begs a priest — an expert in religious matters —  for some insight. Is holiness whatever God happens to love? Or does God only love things that are already holy? What do you say? Socrates’ life is on the line. But we also get to see his “customary activity”: logos. 

R Sept 3 Plato, Apology: Is Socrates Guilty?
If you are introduced philosophy and dialectical inquiry, then you must judge whether it is a valuable pursuit, a meaningless waste of time, or a pernicious danger. Plato’s Apology helps with this. Now, Socrates’ “Apology” is not saying he’s sorry but a defense of his innocence. Why do they put him on trial? What is his defense? His "defense" of himself is hardly expert. And we who are reading from the outside stand in judgment on him just as much as did the Athenian gentleman. We don't get to hear the accusation. But we hear his response. He goes on the same way he always has, asking and getting others to answer questions. In fact, he seems to put the jury on trial and asks them to defend themselves. Is he right or wrong to do philosophy? Is he just obeying Apollo?

Week 04: Socrates II
T Sept 8    Plato, Phaedo 116-143: The soul is immortal because opposites come from opposites
This week we start Plato’s Phaedo, which is about (among other things) the immortality of the soul. Socrates has been sentenced, and his execution has been delayed. In the meantime, Socrates talks with his friends about his impending death. Is death the end? When the body disintegrates, does the soul or life-principle live on? How could we know? Socrates thinks so, and gives three arguments plus a "likely story" to prove the soul is immortal. 
The first argument is that the soul is immortal because life is the opposite of death, and opposites emerge from each other (death from life, life from death). His evidence is a series of natural opposites: hot and cold, waking and sleeping, big and small. And life and death are natural opposites. And death comes from life. So, he concludes, life comes from death as well. 

R Sept 10   Phaedo 143-199: The soul is immortal because we existed before we were born
Socrates argues the soul is immortal. He argues without the help of Scripture or revelation. What is is his second argument, the so-called “argument from recollection”? Is it true? if not, where does the problem lie? In this section, Socrates also warns against “misology” a hatred of argument that leads to skepticism and laziness. Hating the logos is perhaps a danger we begin facing at this point in the semester, too. 
Week 05: Causes I
T Sept 15   Phaedo (all): The soul is immortal because it is more like forms than matter.    
How does the third argument go? Is it true? If not, why not?

R Sept 17   “Forms” handout
Forms (or universals), if they exist, cause things to be what they are. Are forms real entities, concepts, or words? I will introduce this topic before we go over the Kreeft handout. Questions will include: Is knowledge possible without them? Is moral objectivity possible without them? Does the form of circle and individual circles need to participate in a still higher form to both be circular? Also, where are forms and why can't we see them or touch them? Objections to the forms include the "third man" objection, the "queerness" objection. Are these right? Extensions of the theory of forms include important forms like the One, the Good, and Soul. 

Disputation 2 Prompt:   Does the soul live on after bodily death? 
Week 06: Causes II
M Sept 21   Disputation 2:    Does the soul live on after bodily death? 

T Sept 22 “Aristotle” Handout; Sophie’s World, Aristotle: Aristotle and his Four Causes. 
Aristotle was a “meticulous organizer.” He categorized being, sciences, logic, language, and more. His influence is still felt today. The most important concept we will discuss is (again) that of cause. Aristotle teaches four causes, some or all of which cause everything to be what it is. Imagine a bronze statue of a man. What makes it what it is? What "causes" it to be what it is? The formal cause is "what it is" -- so the statue of a man is in the shape of a man. The material cause is "what it is made of" -- so the statue of a man is made of bronze. The efficient cause is "how it was made" -- so the hammer, chisel, and arm of the sculpture. The final cause is "why it is" -- so the purpose of the statue is to glorify the city.   That is the reason that our knowledge can become so complex of an individual thing. To know is to know the four causes (or whichever are applicable) and to be able to articulate them in words. T

R Sept 24   “Lucretius” Handout (10 pages):  Material and Final Causes
Material causes are a thing’s make up. Formal causes its configuration. But final causes are a things purpose, function, or end. Aristotle would say that scientific explanations need to give all four causes. But Bacon says that scientific explanations only give one or two causes. Descartes contributed to this massive change in thinking by his famous wax experiment. Are a thing’s form and purpose incidental to it? 

Disputation 3 Prompt: Do forms (universals) exist in reality or only in our minds? Are forms things and concepts or just concepts? (Due Oct 7)
Week 07: Logos
T Sept 29   (No reading): Logic
Logic is the science of inference. Observation, authority, and testimony provide data for us to reason about. Then inference helps us to make principles of our data, and make conclusions from our principles. There are many kinds of arguments, but the most common are syllogisms. Each syllogism has three parts: a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. The major premise has the major term, which is the predicate of the conclusion. The minor premise has the minor term, which is the subject of the conclusion. There are three kinds of syllogisms: categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive. Dilemmas are a combination of compound syllogisms. The most common syllogisms are AAA, EAE, and AII. 

R Oct 1  (No reading): The Logos: Christianity and Nihilism as worldviews
Christ as the Logos is at once creator, redeemer, and our goal. Substitutes for Christ include nothingness itself, which is mistaken by some as the origin of all things, and the conclusion — the alpha and omega — that which was, is, and ever shall be. Other substitutes include other gods, pleasure, or humans. But other gods, pleasure, and other humans are all consumed by nothingness in the end. So there are only two options. 
Week 08: Midterm

T Oct 6  Toy Story 3 (Pixar Film): How do we survive devouring time?
This is a movie about devouring time. How is Andy’s relationship to Woody and Buzz changing. Also, Lotso is clearly evil. But what is his vice, or his sin? Does it have to do with his rejection of devouring time?

R Oct 8     MIDTERM EXAM & Toy Story 3 Discussion
After the midterm, we will discuss the salvation of the toys. Who saves them, and why? Is it salvation from devouring time? What do you make of this salvation? How does Andy’s relationship to Woody and Buzz change and how does it remain?

F Oct 9  Disputation 3: Do forms (universals) exist in reality or only in our minds? Are forms things and concepts or just concepts?

Week 09: Augustine I
T Oct 13 Augustine, Confessions chapter 1, 2, 4; Sophie’s World “Two Cultures”, “Middle Ages”
We move through history from the ancient to the medieval period. One of the most momentous events was the clash and union of Athens and Jerusalem after the birth, life, death, and attested resurrection of Jesus.  These two cultures fused with each other and formed Christian Europe.  Augustine is a key person in Christian Europe and today. The Confessions details his struggles through personal vices as well as intellectual problems. It tells his youth, sins, eventual conversion to Christianity, and the death of his mother. It concludes with philosophical exploration of creation, time, knowledge, and identity. He narrates his intellectual errors how he was corrected. The first of these errors that has to do with God and reality is the question of physicality. Augustine thought God was physical — what does this mean? Why is it an error? And how did he get corrected?

R Oct 15    Augustine, Confessions Chapter 6, 7, 9:   Does evil exist?
A major theme of the Confessions is sin and evil. Evil for both platonists and Christians and atheists is an essential component of their worldview. What is evil? Augustine's presuppositions make this question difficult. They force him into a dilemma. God made everything that exists. Evil exists. Therefore God made it. Or Evil exists. God did not make evil. Therefore God did not make everything. Those options are intolerable. He settles on the view that evil does not actually exist. What does this mean? What is a "privation" of good? Does this notion make sense and does it make sense of active evil and suffering in our world?
Week 10: Augustine II 
T Oct 20    Confessions, 10, 11:    Time 
What is the relation of time to eternity? What is time? Also, how are we to interpret Genesis in light of our philosophical understanding of time? Time is a big idea. What exactly is it? Three notions of time from Augustine, Plato, Kant. Also some poems on time. Augustine says he knows what time is as long as you don't ask him what it is. When you ask him, he doesn't know. Time is the medium of our life -- everything seems to happen in time. But what exactly is it? We measure time by clocks, by the movement of the sun, by seasons -- but measurements of length aren't length. Time is more like length than like a ruler or a rotation of the earth. Time is either real, or a concept. Kant thought time was a feature of human reason, the very form of sensation. We sense things 'timed.' We sense in a timely manner. Time and space are the forms of experience. What time is or whether it is real he firmly insists we cannot answer. Plato thought time was a moving image. What is it an image of? It's an image of eternity. Time plays out like frames of a movie the eternally real moment. What does Augustine say time is? Is it created or uncreated? What is God's relationship to time?


R Oct 22 Confessions 11, 12:     Creation
Augustine interprets Genesis 1. 

Disputation 4 Prompt: Does evil existence as a substance or only as a property?
Week 11: Aquinas 
M Oct 26    Disputation 4: Does evil existence as a substance or only as a property?

T Oct 27    Aquinas Handout: Can God’s existence be proven? (26 pages): Does God exist? 
Aquinas is the most influential medieval philosopher. He cites Aristotle (and Plato) and Augustine almost as much as the Bible. He wrote numerous books, but his Summa Theologica is his masterpiece. He argues, in a little over 600 topics, about 3,000 disputations. The questions cover God, man, creation, evil, angels, theology, church, and the end of the world. In this first discussion we will look at his arguments for whether God's existence can be proven -- he thinks so -- and the five ways of doing so. 

R Oct 29    Aquinas Handout: Is happiness the beatific vision?
Today we examine Aquinas’ definition of happiness, which is the vision of the divine essence. Aristotle argued that human happiness is one object for the whole species, even though people are very different. Aquinas builds on this argument. 
Week 12: Hume I 
T Nov 3  Sophie’s World, Renaissance, Baroque, Hume, Enlightenment:  The Enlightenment
Now we transition to the modern world. The Enlightenment defines America and through the U.S. much of the developed world. The core idea to help you understand the Enlightenment and counter-enlightenment is a tradition. Alasdair MacIntyre defines a tradition as “a socially-embedded argument extended through time”. Modernity is a tradition of empiricism, rationalism, skepticism, increasing atheism. Today we will work on distinguishing the Enlightenment tradition from the medieval tradition (which resembles the counter-Enlightenment)
What makes Hume a modern? 

R Nov 5  Hume, Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding Sections 1-3:  Impressions
The foundation of Hume's work is that knowledge is either impressions (from the present) or impressions from the past (ideas). The source of all knowledge is impressions, sensory, empirical, input from the world through our five senses, then modified by the mind and imagination in various ways to result in all our thoughts. Any thought that does not originate directly from a sensory impression is nonsense, fantasy. The upshot of this view is radical -- much of our supposed knowledge is fantasy.

Week 13: Hume II
T Nov 10  Hume, Enquiry Sections 5-6:  Cause and Effect
Relations of ideas (necessary, analytic truths) and matters of fact (contingent, synthetic truths) are all the kinds of truth there is. Cause and effect is a contingent matter of fact we sometimes observe. We do not observe causation itself, but only the constant conjunction of A and B (for instance, the ball flying through the window and the window shattering). So all our supposed "knowledge" of cause-effect, including science and everyday matters, rests on a custom, a habit, an imaginary connection. It turns out that the notion of causation -- so important to Plato and Aristotle -- does not come from an impression. We only see the conjunction of two events, not the cause of one by the other. 

R Nov 12 Hume, Enquiry Sections 7, 8, 10:    Miracles
Hume's famous argument concludes that even if miracles ever occur, we can never know that they occur. How does this argument work, and is it true? What kind of testimony (against our experience) would be sufficient to overturn our experience? Do we have experience of miracles?

Disputation 5 Prompt: Does the idea of God arise from impressions or recollection? 

Week 14: The Cosmos I
M Nov 16  Disputation 5: Does the idea of God arise from impressions or recollection? 

T Nov 17 Feser Handout: Can we make sense of the world? Is the world intelligible? 
This question asks not just about the "earth" but the cosmos. Is it "readable", able to be understood? If so, then perhaps we can understand reality, the cosmos. If not, then all of our attempts to understand it are ultimately just constructions of our own imagination. Feser argues that there are six possible positions on this question, and only two make any sense. Of those two, one is superior to the other. Why? Either the world is at least partially intelligible or completely unintelligible. It is not completely unintelligible, so it is intelligible. If it is intelligible, the it is either completely intelligible in itself or partially intelligible in itself. It is not partially intelligible in itself, so it is completely intelligible in itself. If it is completely intelligible in itself, it is either intelligible to us or unintelligible to us. It is not unintelligible to us, so it is at least partially intelligible to us. It is either completely intelligible to us or only partially. It is not completely intelligible to us, so it is partially intelligible to us. Why not think it is partially intelligible? There are brute facts, but why not think the laws of nature are brute facts? Because they are contingent, and brute facts are most likely necessary facts. 

R Nov 19 Dawkins Handout:  There is almost certainly no god.
Dawkins argues that everything god might be invoked to explain can be explained by a combination of the anthropic principle and natural selection. He also argues that religion and science aren’t “separate spheres” of inquiry, each sovereign with their domain. Religion and science have overlapping questions about the origin of the world, the origin of life, the teleology (or purposiveness) of the cosmos, and human nature. What is natural selection? What is the anthropic principle? And how do these two (with luck as a third) explain everything that can be explained?

Week 16: The Tree of Life
T Dec 1 Disputation 6: What is your question? 
For the final disputation, you must design your own question. I must approve the question before you begin. The prompt is due Tuesday Dec 1 The question must (a) Be  clear (b) Deeply interest you (c) Admit of a yes/no answer (d) Be rooted in one of our semester books, handouts, or films. You don’t have to write about “the Cosmos” unit — it could be any topic from Sophie’s World, or Plato, or Aristotle, or Augustine, or anything that we covered or didn’t cover much.

T Dec 1  The Tree of Life (Terrence Mallick Film)
Mallick's film is, in one way, very difficult. It is not as traditional a Hollywood film. It does have a 3-act structure, but it uses poetic story-telling along with narrative storytelling. The best way to view it is to surrender to Mallick's lead. Let him show you, let him tell you, let him make you feel, let him even disturb you... You will get more out of the film if you surrender than if you try to control and understand and analyze. That said, ask yourself: "What is the way of nature?" How isit portrayed? What is the way of grace?

R Dec 3  The Gospel of John (21 pages)
The word of God recreates the cosmos and fulfills it. How does John 1:1-2:1 re-tell the story of Genesis? What’s the big difference that Jesus makes?
