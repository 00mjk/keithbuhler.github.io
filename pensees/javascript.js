	'Two ethicists working with Australian universities argue in the latest online edition of the Journal of Medical Ethics that if abortion of a fetus is allowable, so to should be the termination of a newborn. <br> Alberto Giubilini with Monash University in Melbourne and Francesca Minerva at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne write that in “circumstances occur[ing] after birth such that they would have justified abortion, what we call after-birth abortion should be permissible. <br> <br> Question: if killing a fetus is morally permissible, is killing a newborn morally permissable? If the later is not permissible, then is the former not permissible?' ,
	'The intense controversy that this question engenders is remarkable. On the left, critics of assertive American foreign, military, and economic policies depict these policies as aggressively immoral by branding them “imperial.” On the right, advocates for an even more forceful application of American “hard power,” such as Niall Ferguson and the other members of his self-described “neo-imperialist gang,” argue that the United States should use its immense wealth and military might to impose order and stability on an increasingly chaotic world. <br><br> Question: What is an empire? And is America one?',
	'And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God, / For I who am curious about each am not curious about God, /  (No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death.) /  I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least. (Walt Whitman, <i> Leaves of Grass </i>). <br>  <p> Question: Is Whitmans peace about God genuine? Should we be curious about God or be at peace seeing and beholding God in every object but not understanding Him in the least? </p>',
	'"Diogenes Laertius cites life, health, pleasure, beauty, strength, wealth, good reputation, and noble birth as examples of preferables, and death, disease, pain, ugliness, poverty, ad reputation, and low birth, as examples of non-preferables.” (Nicholas Wolterstorff, <i> Justice: Rights and Wrongs</i>, (Princeton: 2008), 162). <br> <br> Question: Are the preferables Laertius mentions actually  necessary or really just preferable? Are his "non-preferables" horrifying tragedies or merely non-preferable?',
	'If Judaism is a religion, then Christianity is a religion. If Christianity is not a religion, then Judaism is not a religion. <br><br> Question:  Is Christianity a religion?',
	'Adams also excoriated the French speculators not only for their infatuation with human perfectibility, but also for their love of equality. Adams insisted that, far from all men being substantially equal, there actually is a natural aristocracy of men, formed from the benefactors of the unavoidable inequality of humankind. Like Burke, Adams held to every man having equal rights to his own and equal standing before God. Beyond that, though, men are unequal in their powers and faculties, influence in society, property and advantages, piety and iniquity, and nearly every other attribute.” (Russel Kirk, “The Conservative Mind”). <<br><br>  Question:   Are human beings "equal"? If so, in what respect? If not, then is equality a moral ideal or not? <br>',
	'Many people on the left are skeptical towards utopian impulses; at the same time, having allied themselves beneath a moralizing banner, they inevitably find themselves galvanized, inspired and eventually governed by the most fervent members of their sect. For politics on the left is politics with a goal: your place within the alliance is judged by the lengths you are prepared to go to on behalf of ‘social justice’, however defined.” (—Roger Scruton, “Thinkers of the New Left”). <br><br> <p>Question: Is leftist politics utopian? If so, is it necessarily utopian or only contingently? If not, why is "social justice" so hard to define, picture, imagine, or illustrate with examples from history or literature? </p>',
	'Where is my dewelling place? Where I can never stand. <br>  Where is my final goal, toward which I should ascend? <br> It is beyond all place. What should my quest then be? <br> I must, transcending God, into the desert flee. (Angelus Silesius, <i>Cherubinic Wanderer</i>, "One Must Go Beyond God") <br> <br> Question:  Is it possible to go "beyond God"? What does this phrase mean? Is it advisable to "transcend God"? What is the "desert"?',
	'"After the long domination of liberalism, with its adulation of the “common man,” its faith in mechanistic political solutions to all human problems, its rejection of the tragic and heroic aspects of life, and the not exactly inspiring prose in which its ideas are usually expressed, after all this, I repeat, such sentiments as “the unbought grace of life,” the “eternal chain of right and duty which links great and obscure, living and dead,” a view of politics as “the art of apprehending and applying the Justice which is above nature,” came like rain after a long drought.” (Henry Regnery, introduction to Russell Kirk, <i>The Conservative Mind</i>)<br><br> Question:  Is liberalism aesthetically vulgar, socially ignoble, and sentimentally demoralizing? If so, why do socialists blame capitalism and capitalists blame socialists for this vulgarity and demoralization?',
	'If we look for consciousness in the physical world, all we find are increasingly complex systems giving rise to increasingly complex behavior -- which may or may not be attended by consciousness”. (Sam Harris, <i> <a href=http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-mystery-of-consciousness-ii>“The Mystery of Consciousness”</a> </i> <br><br> Question: Is consciousness correlated with or caused by complex physical systems? Is consciousness correlated with or identical to complex physical systems?',
'<h2><a id="Lying_146"></a>Lying</h2><p>&ldquo;Kant and Sidgwick take views at opposite extremes about whether we may tell paternalistic lies. I trace the extremism to their views about ethical concepts. Sidgwick thinks that fundamental ethical concepts must be capable of precise application. Common Sense morality says we may tell paternalistic lies to children but not to sane adults. Because the distinction between a child and an adult is imprecise, Sidgwick thinks this principle cannot be fundamental, and must be based on the principle of utility, which he thinks can always (in principle) be precisely applied, and which often mandates paternalistic lies to adults. Kant thinks that ethical concepts are ideals of reason, which cannot be applied to things in the empirical world precisely because the world is imperfect. We lie to children and the insane because they are not perfectly rational, but no one is perfectly rational. We must treat all persons with the respect due to rational agents, so the pressure of the theory is toward not lying to anyone. In this kind of ideal theory, decisions about where to draw the line must be made pragmatically, like the decision who counts as an adult in the law, and to some extent arbitrarily. But fear of this is not a good reason to abandon ethical ideals for utilitarianism.&rdquo; (Paternalistic lying (to children) is wrong) </p><p>Question: Is paternalistic lying wrong?</p>',
'<h2><a id="Civil_Dialog_157"></a>Civil Dialog</h2> <blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you humanize your enemies, you might be dehumanized by your friends.&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8i0Rwyyc0M">Cassie Jaye, interview with Jesse Lee Peterson on The Fallen State.</a>) </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;Willingness to engage in an honest and civil manner those on the other side is a sign of confidence in the truth, not lack of conviction or courage.&rdquo; (Robert George, Facebook post) </p> </blockquote> <p>Question: Is it morally permissible to dialog in a civil manner with those whose views are not just mistaken but in some sense immoral, depraved, wicked, hateful, hurtful, or deluded? </p>',

'<h2><a id="Normativity_subjective_172"></a>Normativity, subjective</h2>, <blockquote> <p>Korsgaard began with a search for moral entities (and values) that might provide the basis for normativity. She concludes that all the accounts of normativity she discusses are &ldquo;true&rdquo;: Normativity must spring from the commands of a legislative authority. (Hobbes); Reasons are intrinsically moral entities. What we should do when a desire presents itself is to reflect on it, to look at it more objectively to see whether it is such an entity. (Clarke, Moore, Nagel); Reflection has the power to compel obedience, and to punish us for disobedience. It in turn is bound to govern us by laws that are good. Reflection makes us authorities over ourselves. (Hume, Mill, Williams); In so far as we have authority over ourselves, we can make laws for ourselves, and those laws will be normative. Autonomy is the source of moral obligation. (Kant, Rawls, Korsgaard)</p> </blockquote><p>Question: Is autonomy the source of moral obligation? </p>',
'<h2><a id="Normativity_objective_179"></a>Normativity, objective</h2> <blockquote><ol><li>&ldquo;I believe that there are irreducibly normative truths and facts, facts such that we should care about our future well-being, that we should not humiliate other people, that we should not reason and form beliefs in ways we know to be unreliable. These are, of course, just examples: even if I am wrong about them, I believe there must be some examples of this sort, examples of normative (and indeed moral) truths that are irreducibly normative, truths that are perfectly objective, universal, absolute. They are independent of us, our desires and our (or anyone else&rsquo;s) will. And our thinking and talking about them amounts not just to an expression of any practical attitudes, but to a representation of these normative truths and facts. These normative truths are truths that, when successful in our normative inquiries, we discover rather than create or construct. They are, in other words, just as respectable as empirical or mathematical truths (at least, that is, according to scientific and mathematical realists). (David Enoch, Taking Morality Seriously 1)</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote> <ol start="2">', 
'<li>&ldquo;According to Mackie, it is fantastic to think that the world contains objective values, or intrinsically normative entities. For in order to do what values do, they would have to meet certain impossible criteria. They would have to be entities of a very strange sort. utterly unlike anything else in the universe. The way that we know them would have to be different from the way that we know other sorts of facts. Knowledge of them, Mackie said, would have to provide the knower with both a direction and a motive. For when you met an objective value, according to Mackie, it would have to be &mdash; and I&rsquo;m nearly quoting now &mdash; able both to tell you what to do and make you do it. And nothing is like that. But Mackie is wrong and realism is right. Of course there are entities that meet these criteria. It&rsquo;s true that they are queer sorts of entities, and that knowing them isn&rsquo;t like anything else. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they don&rsquo;t exist. John Mackie must have been alone in his room with the Scientific World View when he wrote those words. For it is the most familiar fact of human life that the world contains entities that can tell us what to do and make us do it. They are people, and the other animals.&rdquo; (Korsgaard,&nbsp;<em>The Sources of Normativity</em>, p.166)</li></ol>',
