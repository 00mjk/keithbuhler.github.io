I have been teaching full time in universities or classical high schools for more than 8 years. I served one year as Director of High School Studies at a classical school, and two years as Master Tutor at Torrey Academy where I both taught and designed courses in humanities, Great Books, and western civilization.

At the University of Kentucky and Asbury University, I've taught introduction to philosophy, ethics, bioethics, virtue ethics, and philosophy of religion. Students enjoy my enthusiasm for the subject and personable approach to classroom discussion.

My [research](/research) centers on neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics and metaethics, especially in the writings of Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre. Conversations about virtue ethics tend to open up into conversations about normativity and nature in general. What is the relationship between human nature and human virtue? Between facts and values? Between science and ethics? 

<a target="_blank" href="http://lsolum.typepad.com/legaltheory/2010/10/philippa-foot-1920-2010.html"> <img src="http://lsolum.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bf68d53ef013487f682ad970c-pi" align="right"></a>

My goal is to overcome common objections to virtue ethics by remaining sensitive to these broader conversations. That requires clarifying what 'nature' is in notions like 'natural normativity' and 'human nature'.

The [dissertation](/phd) defends the role of a naturalized teleology in ethical naturalism according to which the concept of a 'practically wise rational animal' is both *what we already are* and *what we ought to become*. Practical wisdom (among the other virtues) defines our human life form and is the natural telos to be pursued. Hence, my thesis sits at the intersection of both normative virtue ethics and metaethics: it is normative in that it commends a life spent acquiring character and epistemic virtues even in the face of (inevitable) death and (the possibility of) human extinction; it also analyzes normative terms and concepts such as 'ought' and 'naturally good' and 'human being' to find a brute natural normativity consonant with scientific naturalism.

In this pursuit, I interact with a group of philosophers such as [Jennifer Frey](https://jennfrey.wordpress.com/), [Micah Lott](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/philosophy/faculty/lott.html), [Chris Toner](https://www.stthomas.edu/philosophy/faculty/christopher-h-toner.html), [James Barham](http://www.isnature.org/Bios/Barham.htm), and [Stephen R. Brown](http://old.briarcliff.edu/departments/theology/theo_new/brown.aspx). 

[David Bradshaw](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/dbradsh) is my dissertation director. [Anita Superson](/https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/superson), [Dan Breazeale](/https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/breazeal) and [Mark Kightlinger](/http://law.uky.edu/directory/mark-f-kightlinger) also serve as unwavering supporters and indefatigable critics. 


Outside of ethics, I work on physicalism (e.g., the causal closure principle), religion, and naturalism. Future work in ethics will address issues in bioethics and  social justice.

Sadly, most college students will take exactly *one* philosophy class. [So you should make the most of it.](/philosophyportal) 

Many people that take a philosophy class find it surprisingly interesting, depending on the professor, of course. (A bad professor can make Disneyland boring.) 
Philosophy is so interesting because it invites you to think deeply. Philosophy invites you to reflect on your own opinions, and everyone has opinions and questions about life, death, reality, science, religion, and beauty. 

The good news is that [studying philosophy is VERY GOOD IDEA](/philosophyportal/philosophy-3-major) because it can help you to find a good job, earn a higher salary than a business degree, and find answers to life's deepest questions.
