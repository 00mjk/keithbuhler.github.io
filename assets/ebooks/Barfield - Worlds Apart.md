#First Day 
It began with a remark I made to Hunter, when I was visiting at St. Peter's, where he occupies a Chair in Historical Theology and Ethics. On the way down to Camford I had been reading one of the weeklies I think it was The Times Literary Supplement and it had left me depressed. What struck me so forcibly, and not for the first time, was that a new book on any subject history, philosophy, science, religion, or what have you is always dealt with by a specialist in that subject. This may be fairest from the author's point of view, but it conveys a disagreeable impression of watertight compartments. There were of course plenty of reviews of purely literary productions. Someone had done a definitive edition of Edmund Waller, somebody else had a new angle on Byron and Shelley and their mistresses, and there was the usual crop of dreary-sounding novels. But I found these interested me less than the reviews of books on extra-literary topics, though it was the latter that depressed me so much. The trouble was this, Behind each review there lay a whole network of unspoken assumptions about the nature of life and the universe which were completely incompatible with the corresponding network behind the review on the next page. It was obvious for instance that for both the reviewer and the author of the book on Psycho-Social History and the Unconscious everything that both the reviewer and the author

It wasn't that people can think at once confidently and oppositely about almost everything that matters though that, too, can sometimes be a sobering reflection. It wasn't that they disagreed. I wished they did. What was biting me was the fact that these minds never met at alL

5 'What a lucky chap you are! I said to Hunter. We were sitting comfortably together and I had told him what had been passing through my mind. 'How do you mean?' 'To live in a world where contemporary minds really meet. A Senior Common Room that boasts an eminent biologist, a Hebrew scholar, an atomic physicist, two or three philosophers, a professor of comparative religion, a chaplain, a Freudian psychologist, and a leading anthropologist, with Law and English Literature thrown in for good measure, and all dining and wining together nearly every day! What amazingly interesting conversations you must have! What searching private arguments that best of all kinds of argument, I expect, where the thread is picked up over and over again each time the two disputants meet and the contest goes on for days or even weeks or months on end.'

I was not, after all, it seemed, shut out from a large freemasonry of discourse where acute minds really met and got down to first principles. Except perhaps for a few undergraduates

Nor, by an odd coincidence, have they. In the end I secured the use of a cottage in Dorsetshire with a large sitting- room and a garden and enough room for four of us to sleep. And I managed to find hotel beds in the nearest town for the rest. We were to see to our own meals, but were let off mowing the lawn. Originally there were to be seven of us including Hunter and myself, but at the last moment I suddenly thought it would be a good idea to ask young Ranger to join in. I felt that his fresh and eager optimism might supply an ingredient that would otherwise be rather lacking. He said he would love to come, though he didn't quite see what it was in aid of. He would come straight over from the Rocket Research Station where he worked, but would probably be a bit late. So it came about that, on a wet Friday night in July, after a good dinner at the largest of the hotels to start us off, we were together in the sitting-room of the cottage, as I tried rather haltingly to expound, more fully than I had managed in my letters, and on the basis of my old conversation with Hunter, all sitting the sort of thing I had in mind. On the whole the response was encouraging: but there was an awkward silence when I finished and switched on the tape-recorder. No one seemed anxious to begin and I realized that I ought to have thought out something definite to lead off with. Fortunately the silence was broken by the noise of a motorbicycle and a few minutes later I opened the door to our late Ranger. He was twenty years younger than any of us. obviously regarded us with curiosity rather than awe, as he looked about him, but it was a friendly curiosity; and when I had introduced him all round and got him a cup of coffee, he said something about its being very nice of us to invite him to join such a learned gathering. arrival, He was just saying it, 'That's very polite of you/ I said. to our friends before No one, I hope, will be personally rude to anyone else, but, subject to that, no holds will be barred. I mean, if A refrains from pressing an argument because he is afraid of hurting B s feelings, undermining his  politeness is the only other in the course of these conversations. 'And that reminds me, I you arrived that, as I see concession we ought to make to each deepest convictions, treading on his dreams, and so forth, the whole thing will be a washout as far as I am concerned/ I was gratified by a murmured 'Hear hear! 'By the way, Ranger, 1 went on, 'why, after receiving a letter from me in which I set out at great length, and with my customary lucidity, the objects with which we should be meeting this week-end, did you say in your reply that you couldn't quite see what it was all in aid of?

Ranger hesitated. 'Remember,' I added, 'what I just said about no holds being barred.' 'You mean,' said Ranger, 'you want to know what I really think?'   to know what everyone here really thinks,' I said rather a prig when I had said it; though it was true. 'Beginning with you, I hope!' I added with a smile. 'It's a bit hard on me,' Ranger began. Then he suddenly 9 collected himself and changed his tone. 'Very well, he said, 'I want and felt you have very fairly asked for it here goes.' Few, if any, people are capable at all events in our time of conversing in the manner which has become traditional in philosophical dialogues from Plato to Brewster and Lowes Dickinson; and not many even of those who can think well and coherently have the faculty of clothing their thoughts ex tempore in linked and properly constructed sentences. Chatterboxes apart, I have never in my life heard anyone, who was not actually delivering an address or giving a lecture, continue to speak without pause or interruption for as long as ten minutes. It will be obvious then to the reader that the tape-recording of what passed between us during our (to me) memorable weekend is, in form though not in substance, a very different matter from this book which my friend Owen Barfield, who could not unfortunately be one of us, has kindly composed from it, with such additional help here and there as my memory afforded. Subject to this reservation, I recall that Ranger continued as  follows
RANGER: You see, I have the advantage of knowing someof what is actually going on. I don't know much thing about the history of science and still less about the history of pre-scientific thought. What I do know is, that three or four hundred years ago for some reason or other the human mind suddenly woke up. I don't know who started it Bacon, Copernicus, Galileo or someone and it doesn't seem to me to matter. The point is, that for some reason at the world around them instead of people just sitting began to look to explore the universe instead accepting traditional theories, around and thinking about it. First of all they of discovered that the earth wasn't flat and that it was not the centre of the universe, as they had been dreaming, but a rapidly revolving and Almost overnight whirling speck of dust in empty space. about half the ideas men had had about the universe and their own place in it, turned out to be mere illusions. And the other half went the same way, when scientists began to other applying the new method practical exploration fields of inquiry mechanics, chemistry, physiology, biand so ology and, later on, animal and human psychology been thought before, from the that had forth.

Fair enough. But unfortunately at this very moment the new method, the scientific method, the method of actually exploring reality instead of sitting still and talking about it, is in the very enormous step forward. on the moon?

RANGER: Of course, I'm personally concerned with the development of rocketry and cobblers think there is nothing like leather. But it's not only travel into space. It's the way all our means of knowing are growing together. Take radio-astronomy for instance: it had hardly started at the end of the war. Now there are about seventy observatories scattered about the world. We are learning about the radio emission from the sun and the Milky Way and the extension of the sun's atmosphere into interplanetary space, we are beginning to map the distribution of the clouds of neutral interstellar hydrogen. Already we are comparing the energy-distribution of cosmic rays as between one galaxy and another. It's reaching a stage where we've got the cosmic rays in our pocket; and once we solve that problem,

15 history of pre-scientific thought and who thinks the Renaissance was the time when everything went wrong rather expecting a broadside. But he preferred to maintain a good-humoured silence. He had incidentally dined rather well. Instead, it was Brodie who spoke next. Brodie is a Scottish Professor of Physical Science, and I was amazed and delighted that I had succeeded in getting him so far south. He is a slow speaker perhaps a slow thinker but,
if you let him take his time, it's worth it. I had wanted him with us because, besides knowing his technical stuff, he delights to brood in a perplexed sort of way over first principles. At least

You could use him very condemonstrate the etymology of the word metastrictly to pure physics in his lectures, hours his acquaintance with the more adventurous speculations of Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Planck and others.

Very well,' he said, digesting this interruption as carefully as he would have digested some acute observation on the behaviour of anti-particles. I thought it was Christian names or nothing with the young people today. I'm minding what you say about cobblers, Ranger. I don't know how it may be with astronomy. I've had to keep my old nose down to physics mostly. If I got your drift rightly, the further you people go with your rockets and satellites and radio-telescopes, the clearer grows and the more you feel you know about the universe. So that you can clearly see away on to the time when you'll know everything, I'm just wondering whether it will work out it all like that at the tail.' 

RANGER: No. Of course I don't think we shall ever know everything. There will always be a beyond'. But I'm pretty sure we shall know a lot of things we don't know now and pretty soon,

RANGER Oh yes. I think I know what you mean. You can't make up your minds whether matter consists of waves or particles. And the particles don't behave as you'd expect them to. But surely that's the whole difference between physics and astronomy. Physics is always going for the smaller and smaller molecules atoms electrons nuclei and so on. But astronomy and astronautics goes out to the bigger and bigger. That's why it is such a relief. It's about time men gave up peering and took to travelling and less'. : instead.

RANGER: In any case, it is only a speculation based on analogy. Why should astronomy be like physics ?
: HUNTER I don't think that'll do. There's a good deal more than a mere analogy between astronomy and physics. You said just now. Ranger, that the mind of man woke up for the first time three or four hundred years ago. If it did (as to which we'll reserve judgment) the waking began precisely when they started assuming that the laws of physics applied to celestial phenomena. For Aristotle the laws of physics applied only to terrestrial or at most sub-lunary things. What you call waking up' began with the substitution of the microscopic for the macroscopic world as the chief object of interest it began when they started assume ing that those laws applied to everything in the universe.

c
! 3 absolutely for granted that modern science is in some way relevant to the dignity of man; that it has a high human value and very likely the highest. And nearly everyone today starts from the same assumption. I not only disagree with that assumption; I regard it as dangerous nonsense. Don't misunderstand me. I'm not attacking science, though I know I shall be accused of doing so, whatever I say. Every kind of knowledge, including science, is valuable. But all kinds of knowledge are not valuable in the same way, or for the same reason. There are many different kinds of knowledge, and one kind is the kind which we require to enable us to control our material environment and make it serve our purposes. You can call it knowledge about things if you like. But there is also another kind of 20 knowledge knowledge about man and about the values which make him man and the best way of preserving them; knowledge about his relation to God and God's creatures. The mistake you make the mistake nearly everyone makes is to assume that the first kind necessarily includes
the second. Perhaps this is because in the old days it often did. As long as men wanted to be wise and not simply 'knowing', they assumed that you could not learn anything about nature (except for purely utilitarian purposes) without at the same time learning something about man and the God who created and sustains them both. This is where modern science came in. Its whole basis the very thing that was new about it was the assumption that, if you want to know about things, you must assume that they are
merely things. You must treat them as objects for the senses, and his but as independent in all other respects of and his values. And a fortiori you must leave out God. spirit man nature, you must treat her as a collection of things in precisely that sense.

Originally the atom was supposed to be an indivisible whole (isn't that what the word atom means, Burgeon?). Perhaps the theory was already doomed as soon as it was discovered that the atom itself was made up of parts, like everything else. But they went on taking it for granted for a long time and indeed some still do.

But it is vanced by different causes at different stages of itself. Inorganic evolution had to rely on mechanical causes; but as soon as life appears, the principles of self-reproduction and variation which it introduces bring with them the new factor of natural selection. Moreover that was not the last major advance, as the nineteenth-century evolutionists appeared to think. With the appearance of consciousness, and a little later with the (for it is a little in terms of the whole vast process) mind in homo sapiens an entirely new phase of growth of evolution set in, bringing with it a new cause or method

It is only in this way that we can learn about the last bit of the past, and about the whole of future evolution. All this has its bearing on my reaction to your argument, to any argument, on the relation between mind and matter. In a sense I do feel it to be nonsense. The unitary view is so much simpler. Because, where there is no distinction, there is no relation to worry about. For me reality is a process, and that process is evolution, and it includes us. You can call it 'nature' if you like. It makes no difference. We are the part of it that has become self-conscious. The mindless universe did not split into two universes because it generated mind, any more than the inorganic universe changed from one to two, because it generated living organisms. It is true, I have heard it argued that this view implies a kind of latency, or potentiality, of life and even of mind, in the inorganic world from the start. But I doubt that. In any
case the point is, that since the evolution of consciousness, certain combinations of the world-stuff have acquired recognizable mental attributes. It is obvious to me that these mental attributes are themselves the instrument of further evolution, and that that is their true importance. But that does not mean that I think of progress or evolution as a moving staircase. On the contrary. For, in the third phase of evolution the
31 psycho-social phase in which we live and with the development of conceptual thought another new factor, another method of change made its appearance. The element of intention, based on the faculty of choosing between alternatives. The human mind does not only reflect the macrocosm in its significance, since that the which is reality, becomes self-conscious. It follows process, of the human that, through its spearhead or growing-point systems of ideas, it is only in the it gives to it its whole human mind mind, the universe may who knows? conduct, Personally I find the thought an inspiring one, and I don't mind saying but perhaps I have been going on too its in future influence, or perhaps own evolution. long? We shook our heads. UP WATER: Then I would just like to add this. When I speak of man or the world through man influencing or guiding its own evolution, I am not only thinking of our new knowledge of genetics and the new technique to which it may give rise, though that may well be an important factor. We may well find ourselves able to make conscious use of the biological processes of heredity which have random. It may be we ourselves and not natural selection, who will determine what mutations are brought about -just as socially organized man already takes a part in deciding which shall survive. It is impossible to say what sort of altogether new man we might learn to

Indeed the production of such a new species may well be the next step for which evolution is even now gathering its
forces. But it was not so much all this that I had in mind. I said that, with the development of conceptual thought, the 3* elements of intention and choice appeared. But that was not the only new thing. You see, biological evolution works mainly in the increase of variation. Simple organisms become more and more complex, and at the same time the number of different species multiplies. The whole world of nature grows more and more varied, more and new more complex, more and more multiplex. But with the appearance of consciousness, and above all of human language and thought, a new principle of evolution appeared.

At least that is how I see it* And it needs some furthering. I painted a rosy picture of successful convergence just now. But it is only half the picture, if that.

The first was the process of biological evolution, with which we are all familiar enough. The second seemed to me to be simply what we used to call history partly actual and partly prophesied. What is gained by stuffing the two into the same bag and calling it "evolution", which I should have thought was a vague and wide enough term already? Evolution is, by definition, an unconscious process something, to put it colloquially, which "goes on of its own accord" as nature herself does. "Planned evolution" is therefore a contradiction

: SANDERSON: Do you mean, way, if He chose. But the answer ; is: I don't know.' Do you?
Sanderson made no reply. I thought I saw a way of leading the discussion towards a territory where I am a little more at home. 'Are what we call "conscious",' I said, 'and what we call "unconscious" really as totally contradictory as mutually exclusive as they sound like Box and Cox so that the one has to go out the instant the other comes in? I should have thought not; although I agree of course with Hunter about the cleavage between an a and a b between experience itself and what is experienced which is the essence of consciousness.' SANDERSON: May I point out a possible source of confusion? Hunter was mainly concerned to answer Upwater; and in doing so he was talking about reason. It was the cleavage he insisted on between reason and nature which made Upwater call him a dualist or supernaturalist (I gather we are using the two as synonyms). But then, towards the end, I suspect he remembered Ranger's earlier remark about the mind being the same as the brain. You remember you stopped him from commenting on it at the time. And this may have led him on into refuting a rather
different heresy. I am thinking of the behaviourists and some of the language philosophers who deny that there is such a thing as 'consciousness' at all anyway in its ordinary sense of some sort of private world of experience, to which the public has no access. I hope I am not overstating it. Perhaps we shall hear more about it from Dunn. I confess I thought we had finished with behaviourism some years ago, but it does seem to have taken a new lease of life from the development of Cybernetics and I think Teed-back' was one of the words Hunter said we could go on gabbling we seem we were black in the face.

Any more than you can exclude myth. Where you have a symbol, you have a meaning of some sort. SANDERSON: Surely the relation between art and knowledge is a point on which we are at least entitled to keep our minds open. Goethe, you may remember, described art as the mediator between unknown laws operating in the object and unknown laws operating in the subject. BURGEON: Yes. And I suspect a very definite relation between the cleavage' we were talking about and what is sometimes called 'distance by writers on aesthetics. But I don't want to go into all that and anyway I'm not capable of it.

The point I am getting towards is, that the ideas or images which have arisen from these sub-liminal processes are just those which have the characteristics of symbols. Ritual, myth, Jung's 'archetypes', poetic metaphors, and a good deal else have been ransacked and examined from this point of view, because the thing they all have in common is symbolic significance. And it is characteristic of a symbol that it has more than one meaning, often many meanings,

call we sometimes contrasted and even opposite meanings, which
are somehow reconciled within it just the sort of thing, in fact, that can happen in the mind, but not in the material world from which the symbols are taken. Symbols are always of the inner world. You may ask what all this has to do with reason, or with rational thought. I am coming to that. Grant for the sake of argument that still keeping to the terminology of behaviourism between his receptor system and his effector system (which he shares with the animals) man has this
'symbolic system', as Gassirer calls it. What is its function ? function is to create that aesthetic 'distance between himself and the world, which is the very thing that constitutes his humanity. It is what frees him from the world. He is no longer a peninsula pushed out by natural forces, He is a separated island existing in a symbolic universe. Physical reality recedes in proportion as his symbolic activity advances. He objectivizes more and more completely. But the symbols were the product of his own inner activity in the first place and they never really lose that
Its
3 character, however completely his very success in objectifying them may make him forget the fact. Forever afterwards, in dealing with things he is, as Cassirer puts it, 3 'in a sense conversing with himself . Now Susanne Langer, who started by writing a textlogic and went on to writing about art and poetry, that this specificaEy human activity the 'symbolic transformation of experience' as she calls it, is one with the faculty of reason. She denies that there is any fundamental distinction between the kind of symbol I have been talking about and the symbols which logicians talk about discursive symbols if you like, or between the conceiving of those symbols and the manipulation of them when they have been conceived. She claims in fact that her theory of symbolism assimilates all mental activity to reason. Yet it is obvious that a great deal of this symbolic transformation does go on beneath the level of consciousness. The most elaborate and universal system of symbols we book on insists , 47 know Is language. And it is in association with the symbols which we call names that we build up, from childhood on, the coherent world of distinct shapes and objects which we call 'nature'.

For in the way they put it I believe there is no room for any element of any continuing imaginal link between inner expression and outer, which is the essence of a symbol. Moreover, in so far as you insist on talking about the brain instead of the mind, I should have thought you came up against the difficulty that arose between Ranger and Hunter. The series of brains, observing and observed, is rather like the procession of oozlem birds. Each bird consumes the one

BURGEON: Possibly not. But you didn't seem to believe that while you were saying it. You did seem to found very much on an absolute contrast between reason on the one hand and an irrational 'nature' going on by itself, on the other.

Even Upwater, for all his dislike of dualism, can't help referring sometimes to 'external' and so forth that we see around us. Or we may mean: (V) an environment which we never actually perceive without the help of precision instruments and for the most part never perceive at all, but only infer from physical experiments or psychological analysis, or both. We do also assume in practice that it is only nature (b) which is independent of our sense-organs and our thinking. I don't
think Burgeon's point is to argue that one is more c reaP than the other. It is enough that they are different, and that, whether or no you could have nature (), you certainly could not have nature (a) without the presence of human minds, or at least some kind of mind.

'Will you and I volunteer to wash up the coffee-cups and lay to-morrow's breakfast for the four of us staying in the cottage, and talk it over while we're doing it?' Nobody appearing to dissent from either of these propositions, I got up and switched off the tape-recorder. Whisky and soda was produced for those who wanted it, and shortly after- wards Ranger, Burrows, Dunn and Sanderson departed for the town and their hotel in Dunn's large car with the shabby body and perfectly tuned engine. After they had gone Hunter again pressed Brodie and me on no account to lose the opportunity which Ranger had given us, and Upwater supported him
firmly, though with less enthusiasm. They then retired to bed, leaving us to do the chores. As a washer-up Brodie was methodical, thorough and slow
the breakfast, senu-Socratic and by the time we had finished the job and laid we had succeeded in sketching the outline of a dialogue which we felt it might be worth while trying to put before the others in the morning. Brodie has his own dry up brand of humour behind his large and solemn face, and he suggested some ways in which we might to the proceedings. He then retired to bed, add a touch of spice taking (I was pleased to observe) a volume of Plato with him. But I was nervous about it and, after he had gone, I sat up till three o'clock jotting down some ideas that occurred to me, and trying to get the whole
thing into shape. 62 Second Day The rain ceased during the night and in the morning the sun was shining warmly down from a clear blue sky a little too clear, perhaps, to give any lasting promise. Soon after breakfast the other four arrived and we all agreed that it would be pleasanter to carry on the proceedings in the garden. Chairs were carried out on to the li ttle lawn and placed in the shade of two trees growing near the house, and garden chairs were found and added to them; luckily there was enough flex on the taperecorder to get it into a fairly viable position between us.

I am surprised that you have not added something else to and your impressive list of the opinions of the ancients concerning the sky and the stars. What have you in mind ?

Many people whom I have met, or whose books I have read, have given a most confident account of how they were formed. Let me see, there was H. G. Wells and even our distinguished friend Upwater, I believe, has no doubts about it. But we must not try to chase more than one hare at a time, in case they should run in different directions. Let us leave alone the question of how these opinions were formed, so that you may have plenty of time to instruct me why they were abandoned three or

It was partly due to the accumulating and increasingly precise records that had been kept for a long time of the movements I should say the apparent movements of the moon and the planets through the sky. Tycho Brahe's observations and the records he left of them greatly surand his predecessors passed in accuracy those of Ptolemy though these had been good enough for practical purthe prediction of eclipses. poses such as calendars and to prove Working with Tycho's material, Kepler was able

But there was another and much more powerful reason. Beginning with Galileo,, astronomers became able to see the stars or more particularly the moon and the planets much closer at hand much more as they actually are. And how did that come about? Had they grown more sharpsighted? For I imagine they had none of those devices for travelling towards them, which Ranger was telling us

Looking through his telescope Galileo saw some of Jupiter's moons. Moreover he could see the details of the moon's surface. All this is an old story. It became obvious that the planets are large solid bodies, like the earth. And this made it necessary to abandon those old ideas, such as that the planets are the bodies of gods; and ideas about the signs of the Zodiac ? Not this alone. I have left out a very great deal. In addition what I have mentioned, much hard thinking was done mainly mathematical in character and a new understanding grew up of the working of cause and effect. Dear ine! Of what kind was this new understanding? Here am I, over sixty years old, and up till now I had thought that the only thing to be understood about causes and effects is, that the one produces the other. And that, I imagine, was well known before the discovery of the telescope. Or am I wrong about that also? No. But there are different kinds of causes or it used to be believed that there were. Before the time we are speaking of it was assumed that the stars are not material bodies at

And I thought what a mercy it was that things happened in that order and not the other way round. Why do you say that? As Hunter reminded us, before the frontiers of time were burst, it used to be believed that man and the rest of the world were created together. But we now know (if I understood Ranger and Upwater correctly) that the universe existed very much In its present form for many millions of hisyears before man was generated by it. And indeed

We now know, beyond any doubt, that all the attributes of the earth which we call qualitative are subjective. My good friend, you are thinking much too rapidly for me. You will have to tell me, first, when this discovery was made and then, in simpler language, what it amounts

as the result it was Galileo who led the way. He discovered of his measurements and experiments, that the ideas men had formerly held about the things on earth, the matter of which they are composed and the motions they perform, were mixed up with all sorts of animistic and anthropomorphic fancies. This, he said, was partly because men had hitherto failed to distinguish the primary qualities of matter from
the secondary qualities. But what are these primary and secondary qualities? The primary qualities are extension in space, figure, solidity, and number. That at least was what Galileo thought. The secondary qualities are everything else we perceive, such as colour, sound, smell, beauty, ugliness and a great many more that could be named. These secondary qualities are dependent for their existence or manifestation startling discovery. It on the mind and the senses. That was a very

Because henceforth it seems that any history of such things must either be a history of numbers, or quantities, or something of that sort, or else it must be largely a history of men's minds and eyes for example, solidity and their other senses. Whereas if, had not been discovered to be a secondary quality, very learned and exciting accounts could have been given of a solid earth and solid rocks and plants and animals and so forth on its surface, as they were men and their minds were generated from them. You say many such accounts could have been given; but many have been given and they are still being given. Masses of evidence have been accumulated and only the details of it are in dispute. I see. I suppose, then, that this evidence comes to us in some
millions of years before other way than through our senses and our minds? On the contrary it is because scientific theories are firmly based on the evidence of the senses that we rely on them. Do you remember, Brodie, that we were talking about the O 77 sky a few minutes ago and I asked you whether men migh possibly (mistaking the appearances for the externa reality) have devised a history of the appearance as if ii were

Can you recall your answer ? Yes, I said that such a man would be an idiot.

this difficulty among the matters you inquire into. Perhaps concrete reality is something of the same kind. I suggest therefore that we leave on one side the difficult problem of for the moment that at defining concrete reality and assume least there is such a thing, and furthermore that it is some- thing other than either the primary qualities or the secondary qualities we have been speaking of, that is, something other than either the external reality itself, which you assure me we discover with the help of precision instruments, or the appearances, which you agree depend on our unaided senses and our minds. Let us assume this for the sake of the inquiry, and then let us see if we can find room for concrete reality alongside the other two. For I take it that, 82 when we were

I I meant the latter, obviously. have just remembered what Upwater told us, namely that some of the learned men who examine the brain describe the secondary qualities as a 'construct' of the brain. Shall or shall we find some other ? I think that one will do very well. Then just let us see what we know about the art of construct- we be content with their word, beaver constructs dams, I believe, using ing in general. as the materials given to it, the trunks and branches of trees and the like ? I have always understood so, though I have never seen one. And when the dam has been constructed, there are two things, are there not? I mean, on the one hand, the dam which the beaver has constructed and, on the other hand, the beaver itself?
Certainly. If we took the A dam to pieces again, should we find anything other than the materials out of which the beaver constructed it? How

By Zeus, you are pulling my leg!
83 I should not presume to do anything of the sort, and I was never more serious. What about a table which has been constructed by a carpenter? In that case also there are two things, the table constructed himself. by the carpenter and the carpenter table which was not constructed by And there is no second

But how is it with those things that are not constructed by one man, but by many at the same time, and which only remain in existence while they are being constructed? I am of a play or a thinking of such things as the performance ballet. Is there a second play or ballet in addition to the one which the performers are performing?

it would therefore be idiotic to devise the history of such an earth ? Something has gone wrong somewhere. Something has indeed gone wrong if, as I myself think, this 'concrete reality' of which you have spoken and which is held by learned and thoughtful men to have existed long before men themselves did, could be no other than just such an externally real second earth as we are at present absurdly supposing. For it seems in very truth that any such second earth could be no more than a kind of spectre, which
the inventive mind or brain of man has capriciously inter- posed between itself, the constructor, and the world of nature which it confidently tells us is its 'construct'.

as we did go into it a bit yesterday, but not so fully did into other things. Do you remember it arose out of the question whether there was such a thing as unconscious, or sub-conscious thinking. I began to get rather excited about symbols and imagination, because I said even familiar nature was no more than a blooming, buzzing confusion until we began thinking as well as perceiving. And afterwards Upwater said, Yes, that was all right, but there was nothing very new in it. And he went on to quote some of the things he had heard his colleagues say about the brain creating or constructing the objects it perceives. Yes. But it was new to me. I'd never heard anything about it. BURGEON: Exactly! The watertight compartments again!

But shorthand just won't do when you are trying to talk about the nature of mind, trying to know something about it, hoping to be shown it and have a look at it. If you do that, you at once become like the man who wanted to be shown over the university as well as over the colleges. For there is obviously no such thing. Mind is a name for the way we perform a certain class of actions. But isn't the question whether that is so or not, one of the things that Hunter and Up water were talking about?

Of course the way we act or react in perceiving depends on the previous state of the organism, as all our other actions and reactions do.

I therefore raised the practical question of how we were to allot the rest of our time, which extended only to lunch on Sunday, the following day; for some of us had long distances to travel. It had already been settled that we should go into town for our midday meal and
discussion, that we reassemble after tea. The we now agreed, after would take the afternoon off and symposium would then continue as long into the evening as we felt like it, but would in any case end in time for all to eat once more in town after which there was to be no more until Sunday morning, when we agreed to begin at the same hour. Before we broke up, I asked Burrows to lead off at the evening session and he agreed to do so. We split up during the afternoon, one or two going for walks in the neighbourhood and others reading or resting. After my late night I felt no compunction in retiring to my room for a sleep, and it was about half-past four when we came together again indoors this time, as the clouds had been gathering in the July heat and the weather looked as if it might turn to rain.

; Apart from Ranger, I suppose Burrows was the least academic member of the party. I do not know what sort of education he had received, but he became deeply interested at a fairly early age in psycho-analysis and I think most of his knowledge of mankind and the world and their history, and indeed of anything else, has been acquired more or less incidentally in the study of that art or science and of the books in which it is expounded. He has been for many years a practising Freudian psychiatrist and a successful one. 'I couldn't help feeling', he began, a tendency here to talk as if there were only three sciences in the world astronomy,
e 107 physics to take and
it biology. Hunter, for instance, appeared last night for granted that, when science turns its attention to being, it must treat him as a biological specimen or a physical object. At least I supposed that was what he meant when he said that science did not know where to stop.' HUNTER No. We are, among other things, physical objects and biological specimens; and there is no objection to treating us as such for limited purposes. Of course, if you start with the assumption that we are nothing else, the purposes will not be limited. If you don't start with that the human : assumption, my objection only arises at the point where you begin treating the 'something else' itself as the object of scientific investigation followed up of course by experi- ment and manipulation. BURROWS Then
: I don't agree. If there is one thing we can
precisely the fact be sure of, I should have thought it is sphere whatsoever that reliable knowledge and beneficent practice in any depend on the application of scientific methods. HUNTER: Goon. BURROWS: You say,

But we have heard nothing so far about the third frontier the latest of the three to be crossed, and in my view the most important. I mean the frontier between the conscious and the unconscious mind. You may not agree that it is the most important. But I think you must at least admit that it is this one which is the biggest adventure so far undertaken by the human race, if only because in this case there is a hostile frontier guard to be overcome. Well, perhaps you know what I am going to say but that doesn't make it any less true. It was Sigmund Freud who first breached the frontier between the con- and a ; and the unconscious and taught us something of the cunning wiles and the invisible power of the censor who guards it. Do I go on to explain what I mean by the

: the whole territory has been explored by the patient work, both in theory and, still more important, in clinical practice, of a generation of Freud's followers in most of the
countries of the world. To anyone familiar with even a small corner of that long story it was an odd experience to listen to a long and apparently serious discussion of the question whether there is or is not such a thing as unconscious thinking. It was like well, really it was rather like the experience of an adult traveller listening to a group of village children discussing whether there is anything on the other side of the hill behind the village. As to the incidental question that was raised I mean, whether the mind should or should not be considered as in some way distinct from the brain, I express no opinion. It's a question to which I doubt if we yet have the answer. when Dunn goes on to maintain at least he seemed be doing so that there is no such thing as a conscious mind, let alone an unconscious one well, as I said, it is simply not possible to take him seriously. The private world of mental and emotional experience, which he if appears to deny, is no longer a speculative hypothesis it ever was one. It is a field of inquiry, which is being as

We simply don't know. Anyway, are our compartments as watertight as Burgeon seems to think? I was very much interested in some of the things he said about symbols, especially when he related them with poetry and art. He spoke of the
symbolizing faculty as the fundamentally human one. Here again it was Freud's outstanding discovery, and it has that the long been established beyond any possible doubt, unconscious mind does operate extensively through the symbols which it uses or creates. Largely disordered in dreams; largely ordered by the conscious mind in a work
of art. This again is something which Dunn's extraordinary approach seems simply to ignore. Where I differ from Burgeon is in the complicated inference he seemed to draw from what he said, that our 112 whole theory of evolution must be wrong. I should have thought with Upwater that that, too, was finally established. Burgeon seemed to be attacking it this morning on rather different grounds; but that is a matter for the
physicists. BURGEON Then BURROWS: Well
: the compartments are watertight after all!
I heard what you both said. But I had better stick to the things I know something about. As far as any inference of that sort from your 'symbolic faculty'
goes, I stick to the rule that, where a simpler explanation is open to us, we should avoid the more complicated or far-fetched one. It a pity Jung did not do the same. simpler explanation has been well tried and tested. Freud, as you no doubt know, found that most, or perhaps all, of the symbols that appear in
is Moreover, in this case the dreams can be reduced to infantile experience, which is predominantly physical, and that even the most grandiose imagery, whether it occurs in a dream or in a work of art or in one of the great myths, is usually a pictorial account of primitive bodily functions or their frustration or feared frustration. You may say this is only a theory. But it is a theory that is used in practice in the practice of mental

So did the theories of Hippocrates and Galen, but we do not infer from that that they were correct. SANDERSON: I am more concerned with the fact that it does nothing to account for the formative function of symbolism in relation to the outside world, which Burgeon also stressed. For you, it is the conscious mind which does all the ordering; but I remember his pointing out that in some ways the ordering or 'formulation' which occurs at the

If you did, you would probably have tried, as I have with mine, to draw his attention to things by pointing to them* It never works because the old fellow, instead of
looking at the thing my finger is pointing to, insists on going on looking at my finger. Isn't that exactly what you are doing ? BURROWS: You have left out of account the fact that the HUNTER dog has no means of knowing why you are pointing. That has nothing to do with it. The point is, that he doesn't know what pointing means. He can't help it;

Dunn aggressive line is due to frustrated sadist instincts; denies his own existence because he is a would-be
chist; Ranger was crushed by his father, or his a power-maniac; Upwater was jealous of his elder brother, so he wants to go on growing up for ever and ever; Brodie and Sanderson I don't know what there is left for them, perhaps they were dropped on their heads by their nurses. Assume all that is true and proved up to the hilt.

Ranger's point still remains. What we now think could still be the truth; and if we thought differently, we might then be wrong. The way to find out is to think5 not about vs, but about what we are saying. UPWATER: I don't want to be awkward, Hunter, but yester- day you were rubbing into me equally hard that, if we know a thought is due to natural causes, we know it is
invalid. HUNTER I said we are mistaken if we think it is the same thing as reasoning. You are justified, for practical purposes, in ignoring the fancies of a sick man who has kept on crying wolf because he is sick. But you are not justified in saying there cannot be a wolf under the bed, because he says 116
: and he is a sick man. If you want to find out for certain, you must look under the bed and see. Especially we are all sick men. I didn't mention if, as Burrows says,
there
is a special irony in my dog's behaviour, because he himself happens to be a 'pointer by breed. He expects me to understand what he means by pointing, though he refuses to admit that / mean anything by it! In and it's Upwater all over again Burrows the same way he says presumably expects what he says, including what about his patients and about Burgeon here, to be taken as an objective description of what he is talking about and not just as a symptom of his own psychological state. If not, what is the point of anybody saying anything? SANDERSON: We get back to the difficult business about unconscious thinking. Hunter must be right of course and there is a realm of thought or reason to which we all have common access, irrespective of any self-knowledge, or any lack of it. If someone says the three angles of a triangle are whatequal to two right-angles, the point is that they are, of the speaker. And ever the state of mind or past history The ultimately that must be the point of any statement. how much of our experience we can get into question is, that clear light. For there is also a much larger realm where our judgments are in fact often determined by impulses and
the fact, but there
is
3 so forth of which we are unconscious. Moral judgments are an obvious example, as I am sure Hunter would agree. Indeed it was his whole case that thinking sometimes is caused by natural processes and that, as soon as we know that to be the case, we reject that bit of thinking as invalid.
It seems to follow that one way out of invalid thinking, and towards truth, is to acquire knowledge of any natural been determining it unprocesses which have hitherto beknown to us. Moral judgments are only one example. If we concede (and I am not sure whether he does or not) that there is such a thing as the unconscious mind and that it has a varying relation to the conscious, I don't see why it
should be denied that there may be a very extensive sphere of knowledge in which access to the truth does depend on

BURGEON: Womb or no womb, I'd like to go back once more to symbolism before we leave the subject.

In my view he has done nothing of the sort; because any such reduction is inconsistent with the very nature of a symbol. There is nothing whatever in

Go a little way farther back: dip into the Vedas and you often no longer know whether you are reading about birth and death, summer and winter, or breathing in and out. Why ? Because symbolic language and all language is symbolic in origin can signify all these rhythms at the same time. Why on earth should language ever have come to be like that, unless it started like that ? When I said that there is nothing in physical objects and events that would enable them to stand for each other, I was of course using the word 'physical' as it is used normally today. One has to try and say one thing at a time. More precisely, there is either no quality like that in them or, if there is something, that something

I don't see how you can get away from the conclusion that two physical objects and events could not effectively symbolize each other, unless they were both symbols of some original or archetype which is not physical (again in the sense in which we use the word today). Symbols which are symbols of the same thing are symbols of one another, SANDERSON: I agree. The whole of what we call psychology would look quite different if we realized that our own bodies are themselves symbols, in your sense, and perhaps the BURGEON: most characteristic and powerful symbols known to us. Yes. Mircea filiade is good on that and incion Freud himself. Psychologically, what is imdentally portant to the infant in his mother's body is, not that it belongs to his particular mother, but that through it he makes his first sleepy approach to the image of the mother with all its cosmological and other significances.

anything Burrows can say about the symbolic significance of oceans and the like, though, even if they had been wrung, he would have been quite in order in saying it here. Of course the liquid ocean is a symbol of our origin. It is a symbol of the one spirit, the matterless universe, from which we all sprang for we certainly did not spring from a mindless one. Of course the physical womb from which we also emerge from unconscious into conscious existence is another symbol of it. And of course the paradise-imago is another symbol of it and one which focuses our nostalgia, filiade by the way also has good things to say about nostalgia, which for some reason has become almost a dirty

But let us keep poetry out of it for the moment, please. Everyone agrees that poetry must deal with nature as qualitative. It is science we are talking

130 to have been formed on the analogy of the concept of
'spectral' in c gas', which is itself Burgeon's sense of the word. The older conof air' as one of the four elements was of course quite cept different and included a spiritual, and indeed a human connotation. Whereas the concept of 'oxygen , and of 'gas' in general, was expressly designed to exclude anything of

that, Ectoplasm, for instance! I don't see why ectoplasm should be dragged in. I know nothing about ectoplasm and I am talking about something quite different. BURGEON Anyway I don't think such a proposition would be self-evidently absurd as I gather Hunter was suggesting. It is only absurd if you begin by assuming the mindless universe. And that is the very point at issue. It and is obvious that Heraclitus, for instance, conceived of I would say, experienced, the elements quite differently, For one thing, he held that he could only perceive them because he also had them in himself. With earth, we behold earth; with fire, fire; with the ether in ourselves we behold the divine Ether; with love we behold love and with hatred, mournful hate.' Not only was heat regarded as one of the elements, like air, earth and water; but love and hate were apparently on the same footing with the elements; and we are hopelessly astray if we try to understand him on the assumption that, when he was talking about elements, he meant simply the material elements, as we have sterilized them.

not. hope
r BURGEON: Well, he taught for years in a Rudolf Steiner that you School, and now the trouble about Sanderson is, know when he is talking Steiner and when he is never
talking Sanderson. SANDERSON: We have discussed this before, you know, It's not so simple. Burgeon. And I thought I had explained. For some of us who have been studying him for a long
than an time, Steiner is more like a natural phenomenon writer or lecturer. His output was colossal; and ordinary as far as I am concerned, it can be divided roughly into
three categories. First, anything he said that I myself have both understood and tested or experienced in some way;
for instance, his theory of knowledge, and a good deal of what he has said about the etheric world and about the etheric bodies of living organisms. Secondly perhaps the feel I more or less understand but the things I largest cannot say I have ever tested or experienced; for example, his account of telluric and planetary evolution. And, thirdly, the things I can't really say I even understand. We needn't bother with the third. As to everything he said that comes in the second category, though I may have come to accept it for good reasons of my own as undoubtedly true, it would never come naturally to me to repeat it without making its provenance clear, or as though I were speaking in my own person. The first is another
matter. I thought I had explained that, after twenty years or so, it really is impossible to distinguish. It is as much Sanderson as Steiner in the sense that it would be absurd to accuse me of thinking as I do, because Steiner thought it also. Just as it would be absurd to accuse Upwater of think- ing as he does about evolution simply because Darwin or somebody else thought it also. It may be 'because* historically speaking, but, as Hunter has emphasized, any rational thinking stands or falls on its own merits. Causes 132 outside the train of thought itself are irrelevant. I claim no if that's originality for anything I have said, or may say what you mean. BRODIE Well, let us go on anyway. I wish I knew more about those old four elements. They lasted right on into the

doer had never actually read anything written before the seventeenth century, and simply relied on hearsay. I have no doubt it has been done. One thing puzzled me, Sanderson. You said something about the elements thinking in Heraclitus. And yet you seem to accept the mindless
universe. How can you have it both ways ?
I didn't say I accepted the mindless universe SANDERSON: would even go some way I was rude enough to shut Ranger up on the subject yesterday.

as a true statement for all time. I with Ranger's friend there, though nonsense to speak of truth itself as 'evolving'. If I can 'have it both ways', it is because, like Upwater, I am a firm believer in evolution. Only I think it has always been as much an evolution of consciousness as a geological or
think
it is in biological one. Indeed, if you were right this morning exhibition dialogue with Brodie, it is nonsense to your suppose you could ever have had the one kind of evolution without the other. I don't see any point in girding at modern you are always doing. For me, as for Upwater, it is the stage which the earth's evolution has in fact reached at the moment. The point is, where do we go from
science as here? UP WATER Where
: do you say we go my gifted friend? SANDERSON: Well, my first answer is: certainly not back to Heraclitus. But my second answer is, that I don't think we can set a course by simply drawing a straight line from the end of the seventeenth century to the first half of the twentieth and producing it. That might lead on and on and on but hardly up and up and up. If Hunter is right, it must inevitably lead as it has begun to do already to as part of a mindsystematically treating the human being less world. If Dunn is right, or if he is in any way representative,
it is even to conceive over, if human find out very much more dignity, we shall not even that straight line, for the simple about nature herself on reason that we have overlooked a basic fallacy in our whole Burgeon already becoming impossible, for many, of any alternative way of thinking.

B ROD IE : It the third answer SANDERSON: Well, then but we would like to hear. when you are trying to talk, in abstractions, about anything as concrete as the operation of mind or thinking in the universe, you get into difficulties, because our whole concept of time is itself abstractions. In a way the old relation cannot one of the be said to be there any longer; the Heraclitus one and the still older relation that Burgeon was speaking of yesterday. In a way
it can. Take this very 'ether* we have been talking about. I have just been criticizing the nineteenth-century idea of it, as on the one hand a sort of non-molecular, atomic gas, and, on the other, a sort of 'mindless mind'. Well, so it was.

The divine Aitker, which Heraclitus said he could only experience because it was in himself as well, and which is not an invention. But our approach to it and, because of that, its whole operation in the world of nature,
quite different from Heraclitus s. And the point is, that it is different because of the process of evolution which culminated in what we call the scienis
5 revolution. An evolution of nature, yes, but also an evolution of consciousness. Heraclitus felt the 'ether in himself, because it was still engaged in making him, as it

Without that, however far we may hurl our bodies or our instruments I think it was Hunter who made this point we shall still be up against the same old puzzle of familiar nature and inferred nature.

136 mechanics. Error only creeps in when, because for certain purposes it is right to ignore the etheric aspect of space, we go on to assume that that aspect is non-existent; and that the nature of space has never altered and never can alter. That produces what Burgeon would call 'spectral' space.

BURGEON: The very place for rockets SANDERSON: The way in which it is convenient to think about space when you are devising a rocket or a satellite may not be the best or truest way of thinking about it when your concern is with quite other things. Let's get back to earth. I believe our idea of space is going to matter a great way we study living organisms. It is almost a matter of life and death there, whether science will continue to think of space only in the abstract terms demanded by the particular science of mechanics or also

: UP WATER SANDERSON: don't see any connection. Well, for one thing, if ever there was a science that has been bedevilled by the pursuit of the very small unit, I suppose it's biology. But I'm afraid I did make rather a sudden jump. Really the train of thought, as it has been going on in my mind while I have been listening,
I just is something like this. We began yesterday by talking about space, especially in its astronomical aspect ; but we got on fairly quickly from that to the question of the relation between the human mind and the processes of nature. Upwater insisted that that relation could only be understood historically and he told us that mind gradually evolved from an originally mindless universe. But he also it suggested that, now it has come, we ought not to think of simply as the mind of the creature called man, but really as the mind of nature herself; since man is a part of nature. She has made use of the human species, he said, in order to become conscious of herself or at any rate with that
result. Then,
it is this morning, I thought Burgeon and Brodie made clear that this picture of originally mindless universe an unjustified extrapolation into the past of a familiar an nature supposed to be mindless in the present though the extrapolators themselves also say that there is no such mindless familiar nature, and that it was invented in the seventeenth century. They criticized the fundamental inconsistency in all this. And when they had finished their dialogue, there was a strong suggestion that, quite apart from history or evolution, the current view of the relation between the brain and external nature is an impossible c one. Someone referred to a magic lantern'. I think everyone agrees that the idea of a mindless universe was the product of the scientific revolution. You also agreed that it was found to involve this other idea, namely, that the quantitative universe has to be sharply former that distinguished from the qualitative, and that it is only the is 'mindless .

it it simply an error', that is why works, when it is applied technologically, I am suggesting, in fact, that this particular idea of the relation between the human mind and the processes of nature, reflects an actual historical change in that relation; or rather a particular stage in a change which has been going on since the beginning of time. It wasn't a new idea of the relation between man and nature an idea of the new relation between them. ; it was If I am right, it is not true to say that the human mind, and particularly its less conscious processes, are cut off from the processes of nature because the former go on inside our skins and the latter outside them. But it is true to say that the thinking of which we are fully conscious is now focused or centred in the brain in a way which does cut us off from nature and enables us to feel ourselves, at any rate, as definitely not a part of nature. HUNTER: Well, it's an interesting speculation, but I don't
see how it could ever be more.

Now the thinking and perceiving on which the qualities depend are no doubt inextricably mixed. But it is important to is a passive and distinguish them, because perceiving is an active process. As Hunter said, thinking is thinking my act. The first question is therefore, whether it is possible

I mean, of course, prefer to try and consider that. mathematics. A good deal of the mathematics in pure science is not pure in that sense. For instance, in mechanics and I you'd have to distinguish between analytical mechanics and with experimental mechanics. As soon as you start dealing as distinct from motions, the experimental physical forces element enters in. But it would take too long to go into that. You can take as a simple example of what I mean by pure mathematics the theorem of Pythagoras, or almost any proposition of Euclid. The point is that it is something

SANDERSON: Very to say that, when we of investigating anything scientifically, it signifies speak that, instead of resting content with a phenomenon as was going presented to us, we go on to inquire into its provenance. We ask how it came about; what was there before that caused it or changed into it. For instance, we rub two bodies together and there is a manifestation of heat. But we do not just say: hulloa, here is heat arrived from nowhere into somewhere! We find out that the heat was latent in the two bodies in another form before it reached the stage of manifestation as heat, and the way in which it was latent, and whatever else that latency involves. Can we apply the same principle activity of the human mind? to the mathematicizing BURGEON: * Mathematicizing'

The form is built from without inwards. If you really look at the coming into being of form, you are simply forced to see it that way as even T. H. Huxley was, when he looked at a newt's egg hatching. And that is where the relation between mind and space comes in. If you really investigate the genesis of the geometrizing faculty in human beings and trace it back to its earlier, latent phase, you can no longer look at a living organism, the way you look at a cardboard box, as an object dumped in an abstract space-time continuum.

still to appropriate for his thinking faculty, engaged in producing, or evolving, the human form. The second period, which I will call 'pre-historic^ is the one which Burgeon was most concerned with. It is the period in which speech was born, and I believe he is right in thinking of all development in that period, whether of man or nature, as having been largely determined by the whole nature and quality of language. You have to look back into a time when words and the thought within them were inseparably one; and, I think it would also be true to say, when sound and meaning were still united with one another in a way we have long lost sight of. The shaping spirit spirits 'invisible artists', if you like who had been at work on the physical form, and I mean on its phylogenetic development, now began to make use of the structure they had created, to work outward again from it, to reappear, in fact, as the symbolizing faculty in which Burgeon and his friends are interested. You cannot really separate the origin of language from that moment, or that process. It is only the third period which I would think ought to be called

As I see it, this is the period in which we are now living and I would say we are still pretty near the beginning of doubt that was why it was able to take such a big forward at the time of the scientific revolution. leap UP WATER Is that all? I thought we were in for something much more exciting. There may be something in what you say about your last two periods. At least any evidence there may be for it can be properly tested by scientific methods, so that it will be either rejected or established. But as to the first period, which I understand is limited to physical evolution, you can have no evidence at all. You seem to agree that the physical body of homo sapiens had to evolve into a suitable organism before it could start speaking and thinking. But then you go on to assert that this organism was somehow 'geometrized* into being out of nothing. SANDERSON: Not out of nothing. UP WATER: Well, out of space or something. It is a pretty and poetical notion. But you must forgive us for being satisfied that in fact homo sapiens was evolved through the rough and tumble of natural selection a process which

: No we still see quite clearly going on all round us. What is wrong with the simpler hypothesis ? Well, you know, we have been hearing a good deal that is wrong with it. Even if we take them both as no more than speculations, I think it can still be argued that my account fits the facts better. In the first place there is this very fact with which I started the broadly homologous relation between phylogenetic and ontogenetic process. We must both accept it as a fact at the hands of embryology. But then, it seems to me, you have to accept the fact as an unaccountable freak of nature; whereas it follows inevitably from my view.

At most you can throw out some casual suggestions about mind having been 'potential in the early stages of evolution. But I and those who think with me are not satisfied with this sort of verbal salvation. As I said, if we find mind or reason appearing somewhere for the first time, we think it is the task of science to inquire more exactly into its Then again it no 3 provenance. And here again, I submit, we get a lot of help from relating the phylogenetic and the ontogenetic approaches. For us, the relation

But then we do not think of man as simply a brain on legs. BURROWS: Who does? not SANDERSON: I rather suspect Dunn does. And sure about Upwater. Anyway we think of him as in all quite respects physically as well as spiritually a threefold organism. He is not always thinking and he is not always awake. He thinks and feels and wills; and he wakes and dreams and sleeps. Even while he is awake, he is still a sleeper in his will. What does he know of his volitional process except its results? and he is a dreamer in his feeling life. It is only in his thinking that he is really awake. And all this is reflected in the form itself of his physical

He has his brain, for his waking life, swelled out into a bubble in his head, but radiating in the form of nerves through the whole organism. In all this, but especially in the head, he can be psychically active,
151 because he is physically passive. He has, at the other pole, limbs and metabolism which also his motor organism reaches up into the head, in the form and function of mouth and lower jaw. And between the two poles his heart and chest, his breathing and his blood circulation which also permeate the whole body, but are focused in his heart and lungs. We say that, when he is asleep and also, even during the day, in his unconscious, from which his impulses of will

It is possible, though it is a pretty strenuous business, to bring your willing systematically into your thinking. But you cannot do

This of course is where we come up against the present habit of scientific thought. It is right that we should. One of the first principles of science is that all feeling must be ruled out, where scientific investigation is concerned. But then it is always assumed that, when one speaks of 'feeling', one means subjective feelings wishes and so forth by which one's thinking is unconsciously influenced. But that is not what I mean at all. There is such a thing as objective feeling, which can be used as a means to clearer thinking and deeper perception.

No doubt they're at the other end of the scale. But I should have thought there was quite enough round about the middle of the scale to rule out natural selection and adaptive radiation as the principal factor in their provenance enough for anyone who is not strongly biased in its favour to start with.

On the one hand it is said 5 that the earth as we know it, including its 'secondary quality of solidity, is a construct of the human brain; and, thus, that brain and solidity are correlatives; on the other hand it is assumed that the earth as we know it was there for billions of years before there was a human, or any other brain in existence. You heard the argument. Perhaps you have an answer to it. I haven't. If the argument is right, the whole thing is a preposterous extrapolation, an impossible fancy. Every bit as impossible as my fancy just now about a theoretically inorganic liver. And the fact

The threat of rain, which had kept us indoors the previous afternoon, had never materialized, but neither had the sky grown any clearer. The clouds were lower now and it was growing uncomfortably hot; but hot as it was, it was clearly not a morning for another session in the garden. Our last session it must be; for several of the party had to leave soon after lunch. As soon as we were all assembled in the sitting-room, and before I had switched on the tape-recorder, Dunn announced that he wx>uld like to lead off. We agreed to this and he began
to us The as follows : DUNN I have been wondering since yesterday evening if I perhaps have been a little lazy. It may be I ought to have said more at an earlier stage; but in any case if I say it now, it may possibly avoid our being led up a false trail and wasting a lot of time.
: may Friday evening the question was raised, and quickly is meant by a scientific hypothesis. If I remember right, Hunter asked Upwater if, by an established theory, he meant one which is proved to be true and may turn out to be false, And Upwater agreed rather reluctantly with that way of putting it. But there On dropped again, of what was no general agreement and
dissent. I myself registered my 162 opinion not only everything Sanderson said yesbut also the whole of the dialogue between Burterday, geon and Brodie was misconceived. It was all founded on a total misunderstanding of what any scientific inference or hypothesis is intended to be or can be. It is a misunderstanding that is very common among those who are neither themselves actively concerned with actual scientific research nor in constant touch with the people who are. Very In my shortly it The assumption from which consists in putting things the wrong way round. these non-scientific critics of science start is, that 'truth' is something to be looked for somewhere behind or beyond experience. Observations, they think, are made, then a theory is formed to 'explain' them; and then experiments are conducted with the object of
proving the truth or untruth of the theory. This is quite wrong. It may once have been what was meant by scientific research, but it is not what is meant today. Any sciensalt knows that in the real business of research the other way round. Theories or inferences it is exactly are not evolved to explain observations or the results of experiment, and experiments are not made in order to decide whether a particular theory is 'true* or not. The function of a theory is, not to give us something called 5 'knowledge about something called truth , which lies in some mysterious way behind the phenomena. Knowledge is in experience not behind or beyond it. Theories are nothing; they are expendable the moment they cease to to help, experience. What theories do is, fit, and therefore first, to enable the scientist to predict events and, second, to enable him to arrange effective further experiments. They take the form of statements of fact (statements about socalled laws' of nature and so forth) because that is the only way language has yet found of expressing them. But functionally they are not statements of fact at all. That is why it is safer to call them "models* than theories. Because no one doubts that a model is expendable as soon as it has served its purpose and no one is in any danger of falsely identifying a mental model, which he or anyone else has

No one questions that important results are obtained by a willingness to treat every theory simply as an expendable model. Point one, therefore: does that rule out the possibility of our also arriving at some actual truth by the use of reason and inference ? Point two if it

before, when scientists finally gave up inferring to spiritual

Brodie's two quotations from Galileo yesterday were a revelation to me. The first one, where he said that error may lurk unnoticed in the hypotheses of reason but a discovery of sense cannot err', was the pure principle of

principle itself was discovered. The
166 'exhibition dialogue', as someone has called it, rubbed in how far that contradiction has been carried since. Surely that way of looking at it was a backsliding into the very mire from which the
scientific revolution had just rescued us It's as if we had started picking up from the ground the broken fetters we had only just struck off, and forging them into new ones of exactly the same kind. For abstract theories are meta! physical causes, and, whether

It sounded convincing, and yet it seems obvious to me that perception is made up of senseto impressions as Galileo and most other people seem have assumed. HUNTER: I shouldn't worry too much about that. When 5 we talk about a 'theory of perception we may mean two and that, if we try to , very different things. We may mean the sort of thing Ranger and Upwater have in mind, that is, a theory of how the brain and the sense-organs function and so forth. That is a scientific inquiry, and the rules for scientific
inquiry (whatever they are) are properly applied to it, But we may also mean the kind of thing Dunn himself does. That is, inquiring into the question how we ever come to perceive and conceive such an object as a brain, or 168 any other object, at all. That question obviously cannot be answered simply by another scientific inquiry into the functioning of the brain and senses. We touched on this yesterday. We must already have perceived before we can start examining. The thing we are examining had first been made
available. How ? We perceive a bit of brain-tissue lying dissecting-table and we form theories about how the brain enables perceiving and thinking and so on. But such questions as, for instance, whether we can rely on the perception we started with, or whether all perception is some kind of hoax or illusion, or whether it is nonsense to entertain speculations about its being a hoax or illusion, obviously cannot be answered by theories inferred from that on a very perception.

How then can you insist that all who inquire into the same subject-matter from the point where you leave off? DUNN That is a cheap gibe.

DUNN As long as you agree that it is a bare assumption.

Your argument seems to be that thinking we cannot, or must not, distinguish the conceptual element in what you call normal perception from the perceptual element, because we never have them separate in practice, because we never experience a bare sense-impression before it has been built up into the complex perception of some is correct (I'm not sure object. Supposing your premiss that it is), the conclusion doesn't follow for a moment. The rule that you must not distinguish where you cannot is divide, is not simply a mistake. It's a howler.

Alongside the genes and chromosomes, all sorts of fascinating field-studies are going on of living plants and animals and their habitats. Well, anyway, I start from the assumption that perception, as we know it, normal perception, proves on analysis to be composed of two distinct elements, one of which is conceptual and the other perceptual. We are usually unaware of the conceptual ingredient in the moment of perception. In other words the thinking in it is unconscious. But just because it is, nevertheless, thinking and thinking, as Hunter has said, is essentially my act', it follows that we do not, as is commonly assumed, confront the world as

The thinking I am talking about, the thinking that becomes an element in perception, is not about our perceptions, it is in them. And therefore it is as much in the world we perceive as it is in our perceiving selves.

The day had by now grown almost unbearably hot and airless and the atmosphere in our little room was quite stifling, even though we had the door and all the windows wide open. Most of us already had our ties off and our shirts open and Hunter now got up and took his coat off, an example which Upwater quickly followed. SANDERSON: Maybe it's because, when I say thinking*, you assume I mean the kind of thinking of which we are

BURGEON only people living in the same period and, broadly speaking, in the same community, who inhabit the same world.

I imagine. My point is that there is the same possibility for thinking. If you systematically strengthen your thinking, so that you gradually become aware not only of the result of it, but of the positive act of thinking itself, you do just that. You become aware of a conceptual area which was previously unconscious. And by doing that, if my theory of perception is correct, you extend the whole depth and range of your perceptions themselves. You begin in fact to perceive parts of the world of which you were previously unaware. You can call it 'controlled clairvoyance', if you like, though it is a word with misleading associations. The point is that, whatever it ought to be called, it is not theorizing. Perception is not theory; it is the subject-matter to which theory is afterwards applied. You can theorize, if you want to, about extended or clairvoyant perceptions, just as you can about so-called 'normal' ones, but they are not themselves theories. UP WATER: Why

Perhaps I also had in mind something that occurred to me, while you on Friday.

Why does it never occur to them that a habit is something you can overcome, if you set about it with enough energy?

Just as observing more thoughts of with the help of precision instruments was quite a different and more observations proposition from piling up more of the old unaided kind.

I myself no longer appeared to have any separate existence inside my shirt. As he sat there in his shirt-sleeves, I saw the perspiration beginning to glisten on Hunter's forehead and at the same time felt it gathering on my own. It was getting quite desperate and I wondered for a moment whether to suggest a break.

Anyway, while we have been having our coffee, one reflection has occurred to me, arising out of some of the other things we have been saying here, and perhaps I might begin by trying to formulate it. First of all, I think Hunter has voiced an objection or is it a distaste? or both? which a good many people feel and feel very strongly, to the kind of thing Sanderson appeared to be advocating. I certainly feel it myself. At one point, while he was speaking, there came into my mind that poem of de la Mare's that begins: 'Be not too wildly amorous of the far' and later how does
it go?

I pressed it all rather hard, you will remember, and does seem to follow, if I was right then, that this deep conviction is after all based on an illusion. It is rather serious, because, as I say, it is not just an intellectual condown viction, but goes somehow to the roots of my being which I seek to choose the healthy into the depths, out of and avoid the unhealthy. That's all I have to say. It seemed only fair to Hunter to lay this card on the table. BURROWS Why do you say it is based on an illusion? BURGEON: Because, if I was right yesterday, the whole conception of my mind sitting safely in my body and looking out through its senses on to a universe which is TzoZ-mind, and with which my own mind has therefore no connection except through the senses, is an impossible one. The whole picture is an illusion, and I myself called the whole apparaa tus, on which this much-prized 'solitude' is based

If you look at the whole of him, in his contrasting but interpenetrating threefold nature, he is a sort of delicate funnel, whereby the whole past history of the world is poured into the present moment. Burrows got into hot water for saying that what a man thinks is less important than why he thinks it. But, when you find a man's thoughts absurd and inconsistent on one point, though they are otherwise competent enough, isn't Burrows right? And if so, isn't he even more right when you

Isn't it possible that we chose to do so, because it is to that very choice that we owe this valued 'solitude', on which our spiritual integrity and our

is BURGEON a very interesting idea. But there is, to say the least, another way of looking at it. It is all very well for you, and Walter de la Mare, and Hunter yes, and I as a precious possuppose for me to prize the 'solitude' session. But not everyone feels it that way.

As we see it, the whole outlook brought about by the scientific revolution should have been must be a phase, only, of the evolution of consciousness. An absolutely indispensable phase, but a passing one. What is riveting it on to us and preventing us from superseding it, because it prevents us from even imagining any other kind of consciousness, is precisely
this error of projecting it back into the past. The error that Burgeon was tilting at: our distorted image of history. It is rather as if someone, who had never seen himself before, had learnt for the first time to make a mirror; only he had accidentally made it convex. So that he assumed that he and all men before him were like the little waddling reflection he has just succeeded in producing. It is a terrific achievement to have made a mirror at all. But the justifiable pride he takes in it ought not to prevent him from learning to make a truer one. History, at least any kind
is still very much in its infancy. Later be very different and we shall get the on, true picture of evolution instead of the false one. And then the sort of problem we shall be discussing will be, not, how can there possibly be such a thing as consciousness outside the body, and do we want it if there can, but rather: how of universal history,

UPWATER: as it drew into the body, so to speak, from some sort of existence outside it. But to maintain that that happened phylogenetically makes nonsense. Where is the continuity ? The process is interrupted over and over again by death. In the case of the body itself that doesn't matter, itself because the individual organism will have reproduced before it dies. But, according to your own account, that cannot also apply to its self-consciousness. The whole process, from without to within, happens afresh with each child. How then can you speak of a gradual evolution of
self-consciousness ?
I SANDERSON:
more that objection applied of putting it. He speaks of a gradual way evolution of self-consciousness out of a consciousness which was still 'diffuse' and he seeks to maintain this within the general framework of orthodox evolution, the *spectraP evolution according to which matter came first and evolved to mind. But that, as you say, is not an evolution of self-consciousness at all. It can at most be an evolution of ephemeral vehicles or organisms which gradually beto Chardin's would have thought came more capable of sustaining self-consciousness. To propound an evolution of self-consciousness out of another
kind of consciousness presupposes continuity, so that the evolved self could, as it were, look back to the previous stages in which it was less of a self than it is now.

If the two
are really homologous, however, there
is something else which follows, and it is this. If you accept any phylogenetic evolution, you must presuppose that the particular form you are studying, from the moment when it emerges as a particular form, has had a continuous existence of some sort, an abiding unity through all its variations. True, the form appears only in successive embodiments, which are born and die again. It is an interrupted continuity. But, unless it continues to be the same species, whose evolution you are tracing, there is nothing to trace, nothing to study, nothing to talk about, BURGEON No subject for the verb

That, as
as SANDERSON: It strikes you as oriental, because in modern times we have mostly so far heard about it from the East.
I see it, is because the East has never forgotten, have, the old cloudy and inaccurate, but elementally sound, wisdom which was once universal. The West has chosen to forget or disbelieve it perhaps as wilfully and we unreasonably as you yourself have pointed out it has chosen to believe in a mindless universe. B ROD IE Why not say 'as idiotically' ? SANDERSON No, I would say out of the same unconscious drive. Anyway, don't mix up two things. The mere fact of re-birth is no more oriental than the fact of birth. They are both of them neither oriental nor occidental. What you
:
: are reacting to in accord with is
its the oriental attitude to re-birth
attitude to birth in general, which is and consists in regarding it as more of a catastrophe than a blessing, and in the devising of means of escape from it. BURROWS Well, we could cure them of that.

It was this last practice that the scientific revolution got rid of or should have done. B ROD IE: Then you don't personally remember your previous incarnation ? Lord, no. My unconscious is about as unconscious as the next man's. BURGEON: And I suppose in this case the 'someone who Rudolf Steiner ? reports to us about reincarnation is

But we do not achieve this unity by forming new ideas about the nature of the unconscious, or even about what is going on in our own unconscious, because all that still remains in quite difthe one sphere of thinking.

You do that with willed to other objects than a thinking, if you practise attention you practise regularly, over a long period, the mind on one single concept or one single concentrating all else. Of course it must be a object^ to the exclusion of without emotional overtones. concept That is one thing; and of course it is only the very

sort of pursuit tended experience, which I have argued for, also requires a systematic cultivation of feelings feelings evoked by selected images and symbols, for instance, and feelings about the processes of nature and her appearances. One must take pains to become able somehow not merely to feel but deliberately to use one's feelings as a means to percepfor investigation; to treat them as a precision instrument
to develop ting quality, just as we take enormous pains external precision instruments for investigating quantity. BURGEON: There is something awfully unnatural in the idea
of deliberately setting out to feel

To full waking consciousness immediate ex- perience is its own guarantee. You can't go behind it. I agree with Dunn there, but I don't agree with his limitation of experience to what he calls 'normal*. We have really
all that. Somebody Burrows drew attention to this trick of picking out the simplest examples and leaving out all the rest. Does, for instance, the 'normal include any element of active imagination? And if so, why been through 5 must it be just so much and no more? Burgeon knows very well that, when we experience a symbol, its symbol-nature is part of the experience itself, not something we infer abstractly
after first experiencing
it as literal. BURGEON: Everyone who has learnt

But I gather no one wants to go back over all that. I will finish as quickly as I can. Perhaps I ought to try to give some detailed example, however hurriedly selected,

all this Now we may and choose, instead of casually noticing to concentrate on the qualities perhaps poetizing it, really and on the processes they betoken, and then deliberately to cultivate strong feelings about them. I don't of course mean emotions of melancholy or hopefulness, but some189 impersonal more akin, perhaps, to our in music. Again, we experience of the minor and major keys both in observation and feeling, the altercan experience, nate expansion and contraction, which characterizes the

Of but eventually, as a result of that and of many other steps in the same direction, one may come to a direct experience of those formative, structure-bestowing forces from space, of which I tried to speak before.

There is no other road to a science of the qualitative. Take colour, for instance. You can treat it spectrally (in both senses of the word!) as waves or vibrations. But in doing so you lose colour itself altogether. For we never actually experience the vibrations. If you want to investigate colour as a as Goethe did quality, you are obliged to approach it without forgetting our normal experience of it as a sort of bridge between the outer world of perception and the inner world of feeling. That is why the people who are because practically concerned with the quality of colour their bread and butter comes from colour-printing or colour-reproduction are at present busy studying Goethe's theory of colour, or rediscovering it for themselves.

It is not Sanderson's fault, but it seems to me he has not yet attempted to meet the objection it all began with. All he has done is to put up a sort of argumentwn ad hominem to Dunn, claiming that in Dunn's view of the nature of science (which in some mysterious way he himself seems nevertheless to accept) you could never have a science dealing with the past at all. Is
that right ? BRODIE I think so. Yes. BURGEON: Then what about the objection, Sanderson? SANDERSON Our time's getting very short, but I'll do my best. You must remember the position I start from: that

Most people feel that their menbut we feel tal experience is a kind of replica of nature nature herself as a replica of mind. Burgeon at least seemed And I ; to agree with this in theory, when he was talking about sym5 bolism and the origin of language. Need we go again into the relation between 'thinking and 'I think ? To say that nature is history displayed is really to say that nature is man's unconscious being, displayed objectively before him. I don't think it matters much whether you put it that way or whether you say, with Goethe and to some extent with Chardin and perhaps even Upwater that human consciousness is the mirror in which nature surveys herself. The point is, that

The past remains latent in the present, perhaps in something the same way as it does in the meaning of a word. I don't think I can be more precise. I could not be without beginning to speak of hierarchies of creative beings, and there is obviously no time for that, even if you We wanted it.

Consciousness and pole and his unconscious at the other. unconsciousness are mutually exclusive; but the mutual exclusion of two opposite poles is resolved in the tension between them and the motion it begets. In the case of the unconscious the spiritual polarity between conscious and motion begotten is rhythmic it finds expression in the course of time and the various rhythms of nature.

That, which our sojourn as we see it, is the process of human and cosmic evolution. If it bears at all the stamp of truth, it is the less surprising that Burgeon here and others should find in a persistent image of paradise the symbol of symbols, or that they should detect that image not only in actual myth and symbol, but also in the face of nature herself when it is seen as a face and not simply stared at as a spectral mask with nothing, or what have you, behind it. Or that Burrows, and those whom he follows, should trace that image above all in the particular bit of nature with which the subconscious mind simply cannot help remaining on more do half lovely, half distorted relic of the weightless paradisal harmony from which it has shrivelled and shrunk to what it is.

in the bosom of the race that the longing of the psyche harks back to its source. It would have returned there from time to time to refresh itself at the miraculous founts; and would have experienced other and lesser falls. It would be concealing in itself the recollection of a much

You say that you develop your powers of cognition by meditating intensively on growth and decay. Is it surprising that the resulting model of the universe is mainly one of alternating expansion and contraction ? SANDERSON: You have

The real point is, that there is a difference between what I tried so lamely to describe and merely preoccupying oneself with an idea and then transferring it elsewhere as a thought-model. I did go into it at some length, and no one will want me to do it all over again. We actually have the

Their weak spot is that in practice it is all Steiner himself and what he said. They tell you that the clairvoyant faculties he acquired can be acquired by anyone, but on their own showing the movement has been in existence for fifty years or more without producing anyone in the same street with him or even in the next street but one. Descriptions like the one you have just given us are all traceable to Steiner, never to his followers. It is not just Steiner first and the rest nowhere; it is Steiner in the field and the rest non-starters.
: Yes. But there is scientist. I make it my business SANDERSON: I think, if you went a little more into detail, you would find that his followers have added a little here and there. But by and large the complaint is justified; and in that respect, though not at the point on which I actually brought it to bear, the analogy with ordinary science falls to the ground. It is a pity that it should be so ; but when you

In the last resort it sense which I have alien to our present ideas depends on a principle that is and is, acknowledged at almost all though it has been, times and places except in the West during the last few hundred years. I mean the principle of initiation. Anyone who knows anything about it at all knows that according to that principle a person does not become an initiate he has merely by growing more acute or more learned; to become a different kind of man. Even the actually what we mostly hear degenerate caricatures, which are all bear witness to this principle. And no one who about,

We have seen the kind of 202 early, awkward, either to this, or to despair that double-think the human intelligence will resort to rather than admit to itself the bare possibility of being outside the body. But there are other indications; indeed, I would think that the current hysteria over space-travel had something to do with it. There is this instinct to get away outside into space; and there is this fear of it. If only we could get outside the body and yet take the body with us! But I imagine it will be a long time before these pressures are recognized for what they are; and in the meantime, for us ordinary men, the mind is indeed bound indivisibly to the brain and the senses; and there are only two ways of disentangling it. One of which is death and the other intitiation. The relation or resemblance between the two is also something which transpires through every recorded tradition. It is not only intellectual development, or only intellectual and emotional development, that will serve to accomplish it. Death is not a jest; the threshold between man's conscious and his unconscious is not a jest; the ordeal connoted by initiation is to be sustained only by moral integrity and moral energy raised to a power not

But nature nature makes unlikely jumps ahead from time to time. Advance raids, as it were, with which the main body takes a long time to catch up. You said a good deal about mutations on Friday evening. But you also suggested that the spearhead of evolution was now to be found in humanity and in the social and mental rather than in the biological sphere; moreover, that it had come to depend more and more on human volition.
