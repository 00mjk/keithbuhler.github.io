**"The Case for Agnosticism Regarding Causal Closure." *Religious Studies.* (revise and resubmit)**

*Advocates of the causal closure principle (CCP) sometimes talk as if the case for CCP is pretty well closed. We here dispute this confidence. None of the extant arguments give sufficient reason to affirm causal closure: deductive arguments beg the key question while inductive or abductive arguments are inconclusive enough to provide equal support for causal openness. Better arguments may be forthcoming but in the meantime we conclude that the case for causal closure remains open.*
