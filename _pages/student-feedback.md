## Good

### Readings

" Many of the texts were very interesting. I appreciate that the Prof. Buhler understood the struggle of learning Philosophy at 8:00 in the morning."(PHL293 2016)

### Lectures

"This professor is passionate about what he teaches his students, and is really good at keeping the class engaged. He is very knowledgeable." (2015, PHL200)

"The course was really interesting, and the teacher was very engaging. I expected this gen-ed to not be fun, but he made it interesting, fun, and I learned a lot about how to think differently about things."(2015, PHL200)


"Keep drawing on the board! I'm a visual learner and your drawings are very helpful."

### Classroom Environment and respect

"Instructor made the course. Great environment to learn and discuss-made the classroom a comfortable place to share ideas and grow in knowledge. One of my favorite professors." (2015, PHL200)

"Buhler is a fantastic teacher. He is very theatrical about philosophy which is great. He treats us like adults and enjoys discussion. He really brings out the best about philosophy. None of his assignments are busy work. He learned our names very quickly and took time to understand our points in discussion. He is very knowledgeable about many things and has a very open view to discussion."

### Discussion

"Very engaging teaching style. Allowed a lot of room for class discussion providing a fun and engaging learning environment."(PHL293 2016)

"• I loved the class discussions. Buhler always encouraged in class discussions and cared about us as people."(PHL293 2016)

"I enjoyed pretty much every aspect of the class. I really liked that I was able to process on my own and post about it since I hate talking in class. I also liked that even though I generally don't like to, I never felt too intimidated to speak when I wanted to because the environment was so friendly and conductive to learning and participation." 

### Participation without discussion

"Allowed different means of participation. Rather than making each student participate out loud in class, he provided ways for different types of learners to meet that portion of their grade. He made a fun learning environment. He did not treat us like we are in high school, he treated us like adults and like college students should be treated. He realized that we are capable of making decisions for ourselves and that we are responsible for ourselves. He respected us as students." (PHL 200 2015)

"I have a tough time thinking outside the box in a philosophical manner so this course really challenged me. I am grateful that the internal/external processor idea was put into action because I freak out if I have to talk in front of the class." (2015, PHL200)


### Writing Disputations

>Going back to the topic of is Evil a substance or privation of goodness. I would say that this topic was very challenging to me because I was constantly changing my mind and thoughts during the disputation, class talk, and readings...  the most influential change came from my disputation however because it was a time for me to reflect... and start to put my thoughts together instead of just letting them roam in my head. Each section of the disputation allowed me to grasp my thoughts and the question of the topic that much more. (PHL 200 2016)

### Quizzes

### Busy work


"The vast majority was discussion driven. Most other Philosophy classes I hear of are filled with terms, theories, and endless quizzes. This class was focused on having the class externally or internally process the topics we went over. The reading in the course was not some impersonal textbook with dates, names, and definitions. We read the words of actual philosophers." (PHL200, 2015)

"I enjoyed that the main focus of this course was not about the grade, but more outlined on learning and understanding ethical concepts and formulating your own opinion on them." (PHI305-002 2016)

### Philosophical Content

"I really enjoyed this course and it has helped me grow in my faith more than any other class I have taken."(PHL200)

"I liked the way that he challenged our views on life and the fundamental concepts of everything." (PHL200 2014)

### Gratuitous Praise

"Mr. Buhler is probably the best Prof I have ever had. He has a genuine interest in the student and spends time outside of class and office hours with students to help them succeed. He is not only interested in producing excellent students, but excellent human beings. He provokes thought and helps students to reach new places of understanding. Mr. Buhler is excellent." (PHL200 2015)

"Prof Buhler was an incredible teacher. I have a tough time thinking outside the box in a philosophical manner so this course really challenged me. I am grateful that the internal/external processor idea was put into action because I freak out if I have to talk in front of the class. I wish I hadn't been so sick this semester though because I got a lot more out of actually going to class than I did doing things on my own. I might not have enjoyed participating in the discussion, but I've always been more of an observer anyways and the things that students said really intrigued me and forced me to think."

"Prof. Buhler is really great. I have been recommending the course and him to all my friends. Honestly, this course was the one this semester that I enjoyed going to the most and got the most out of. And maybe while I didn't quite show it, every class period left me with more questions about our world and left me with a feeling like I was understanding things in a new light. Honestly, I wish Prof. Buhler would teach all of my classes here are Asbury. Even if he didn't know the subject matter, I would still come for the jokes, and doodles on the board, and the overall pleasantness he brings to the classroom."

"One of my favorite professors at Asbury, Buhler makes learning philosophy so inspiring, challenging and exciting. He has encouraged me through class discussions and personal one-on-one time in the pursuit of a deeper understanding of wisdom, faith, maturity and (of course) humor. I would not be the same person I am today without his leadership."


## Bad

"Graded Unit Papers did not always have comments, but questions or concerns were always quickly responded to in emails or in class."(PHI305-002 2016)

"I did not appreciate the online quizzes because I felt that they were unnecessarily excessive and were worded confusingly. The online quizzes did not benefit me in anyway."(PHI305-002 2016)

"The midterm study guide questions were MUCH different than what was on the midterm exam, this posed a challenge when studying."(PHL200 2014)

"The course also required a lot of reading, which needed to be read fairly quickly. It would have been helpful to have dropped a book or a few less necessary lectures in order to offer more time to finish the readings." (PHL200 2014)

"Was very slow at responding to emails."

"I wish he had been almost less respectful of our thoughts. I felt like we wasted so much time in class that we could have spent listening to Buhler lecture because he is brilliant and then commenting on the lecture and readings that we have come to class already understanding rather than stumbling through reading them together in class."(PHL293 2016)

## Ugly (because drama is fun)

"Suggestions for improvement of this course: - Actually teach a class not just have a discussion with a very vague outline."(PHL200 2014)


"This course was, to be quite honest, a waste of my time. Students do not have a strong enough foundation in philosophy and critical thinking to have intelligent discussions about the material. This course is one that I will forget everything I learned by the time I've finished the final."(PHL200 2014)







I enjoyed pretty much every aspect of the class. I really liked that I was able to process on my own and post about it since I hate talking in class. I also liked that even though I generally don't like to, I never felt too intimidated to speak when I wanted to because the environment was so friendly and conductive to learning and participation.

Very funny and tried to crack a lot of jokes. Also, full of energy for an 8AM.(PHL200 2016)


## (PHL 200 Fall 2016)

>This business ethics course based in philosophy has been hands-down my favorite course of the Fall 2016 semester. I felt there was an incredible atmosphere constructed in the course leading to extreme comfort ability and a safe place to express opinions. (PHI334 2016)

> Lastly, thank you for your time and consideration you've put forth in teaching a large majority of the philosophical content I have learned throughout my college experience. You've had considerable influence on me regarding how to carry oneself, how to get a group of people involved and enthused, and most importantly, how to make an individual interested in the material. I've been in several unique classes through which I've seen students of every which major state your course as more than "just an elective" and I think you'll continue to inspire people as you move forward. Positivity that radiates is something that several people do not have or have simply lost throughout the years, and I can't envision that being your case after the several classes I've taken part in.

As a student at Asbury University I always ask upperclassmen what courses they took and with what professor. I was told by many to take Philosophy with Buhler; “because he’s great and actually teaches you” they would tell me. Coming into this class, not only did I sign up late, but I had no idea what this class was even about. I didn’t even know what Philosophy was.    

>    Overall, Intro to Philosophy changed me and my thinking for the better.  I can honestly say I have never thought so hard about life.  I used to think I thought a lot about life, but I can now say I was wrong to think so.  I now catch myself questioning different ideas and themes regarding humanity, God, the world, etc.  This questioning leads me to further contemplation and the action of seeking out answers.  Philosophy also taught me that it’s okay to admit to ourselves that we don’t know anything, and that this is the first step to finding a passion in learning.  I’m very thankful to have been able to take this course this semester.

>    This class was about not panicking when you’re hit with difficult question/thought it taught you not to take the easy way out but instead to look into the depths of the questions and ride it out until you can’t anymore regardless if you couldn’t find a solution.

>    Coming into the class I think I expected to be learning about countless philosophers, specific dates of their theories, and a bunch of textbook reading. Luckily the class was not anything like I expected. This class was primarily about preparing us to be able to think like a philosopher and therefore be able to understand philosophical works more proficiently. 


> I really enjoyed the class layout and the way Dr. Buhler taught the class. The discussion format was quite conducive to learning. While I couldn't disagree with him more on many topics, and felt disrespected/insulted quite a few times, I did think that he did a great job teaching Socrates and Plato.
