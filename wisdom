# Wisdom

A society is known by its aphorisms. Here are a few of mine. 

1. **Givers and Takers**. There are two kinds of people: givers and takers. Givers sometimes take and takers sometimes give, but mostly one is disposed to give most of the time or take most of the time. Givers are by and large happier. Takers aim for happiness but are by and large unhappier. Givers give to each other and to takers. Takers take from other takers, but it does not go well, and so they settle down to take from givers. When two takers marry, they are stay miserable or divorce. When a giver and taker marry, taker becomes miserable and either files for divorce or remains miserable, while the giver might remain happily married. When two givers marry, they remain happily married. When givers work a job, they move up the ranks, or start a business. When takers work a job, they do the minimum, get fired. 
2. **Straight Paths**. Al Geier said that dialectic is a winding, wandering path as you walk it and that, when you arrive at the destination and turn around, it is a straight line.
