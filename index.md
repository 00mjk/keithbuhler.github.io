Keith Buhler is a philosopher and classical educator. He currently works as a postdoctoral lecturer at the University of Kentucky (where he recently completed his PhD) and part-time instructor at Asbury University. 

His research focuses on virtue ethics, metaethics, and related topics in the history of philosophy and the philosophy of science. For example, he investigates the concept of a human being and a *good* human being. Is the happy life a rational life? Answering these primary questions requires rethinking the relation between facts and values, or between nature and normativity: does science have anything to contribute to ethics? Is ethics a science? 

Dr. Buhler has been an educator for more than nine years. He has taught at the high school and college level, as well as given public lectures to all ages. His teaching interests span the curriculum, from Plato and Aristotle to contemporary film.
