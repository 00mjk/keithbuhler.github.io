Hi, thanks for visiting. I am currently [**teaching** philosophy and ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and at the University of Kentucky. I have more  than 15 years of teaching [experience](/Buhler-CV) and really love what I do. 

My current [dissertation **research**](/research) is in virtue ethics, specifically the ethics and metaethics of recent neo-Aristotelians such as Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre. My interest is in the relation between virtue, practical reason, and happiness.

I have competences in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, and philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community, and to help [**students**](/philosophy) do so as well.
