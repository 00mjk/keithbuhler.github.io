## Hi, I'm Keith Buhler.

I am a philosopher, educator, researcher, and writer.

Thanks for visiting. This site introduces my professional work in philosophy and education. It also hosts a few random personal projects that might be of interest to some. 

As an educator, I teach [philosophy and virtue ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and Health Care ethics at the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226). Folks tend to [really like my classes.](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771)

As a graduate student, I'm writing my [dissertation](/fun-stuff-folder/phd) on virtue ethics. Specifically, I analyze the concept of virtue in five contemporary thinkers: Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Rosalind Hursthouse, and Robert Adams. What are virtues and what are vices? Is the pursuit of virtue selfish? Is wisdom a virtue? Is virtue "natural"?

As a researcher, ethics is my primary focus right now. But I also find myself puzzling about [metaphysics, philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, and philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler)

As an artist, I love to [write other things too](/writings), [to read](http://www.readingintentionally.com/2012/04/readers-are-leaders.html) and to [help others read](http://www.readingintentionally.com). Feel free to explore this site or send me a note. Thanks,
