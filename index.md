My [dissertation](/research) (which is coming along!) is an explication and defense of some recent neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics. I have been [teaching](/teaching) for more than 15 years and love what I do.    Some other philosophical interests (in no particular order) include [Plato, hylomorphism, physicalism, feminism, religion, and science.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler)   Some non-philosophical interests include clay sculpture, YouTube videography, web programming, and composing lists of my interests. My philosophical quest is not only to contribute to our discipline but also to flourish as a human being in community with my students, colleagues, and friends. This website hosts my CV, course syllabi. Here are some other online profiles: [UKY](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226);  [Phil Papers](http://philpapers.org/profile/47267); [Academia.edu](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler); [Rate My Professors](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771).
