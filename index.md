This site is a guide to my professional and personal activities. 

As a philosopher and classical educator, my mission is to help people (in the classroom and out) to pursue love and wisdom. My tools are teaching, coaching, and modeling the practical skills that bring about human flourishing. 

Achieving the high goal of human flourishing, and understanding its relation to each person's particular circumstances, is difficult. The pursuit requires identifying and fighting the many vices that so easily entangle; and it requires cultivating virtue in daily life. It requires pursuing wisdom tenaciously. 

Yet all these things are possible. 

Thank you for visiting. Please explore my research, blog, or some of the other fun and interesting resources on this site intended to enrich your journey.
