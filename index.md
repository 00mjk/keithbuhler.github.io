Currently, I am finishing my PhD in philosophy at the [University of Kentucky.](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226) My dissertation centers on contemporary analytic virtue ethics. 

For more than 8 years, I've successfully helped learners of all ages to grow and flourish. I use humor and immersive Socratic dialogue about great books to create a friendly yet rigorous learning environment.
