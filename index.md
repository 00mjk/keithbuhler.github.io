### Hi, I'm Keith Buhler 

<img src="/img/keithbuhler-golden.png" alt="Keith" align="left" hspace="20" height="485" width="300">

Thanks for visiting. I currently teach [philosophy, health care ethics, and virtue ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and at the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226). I've been [teaching](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771) for about [14 years](/Buhler-CV) and really love what I do.

I’m also currently writing my [dissertation](/research) on virtue ethics. I’m especially interested in dialoging with neo-Aristotelians such as Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, and John McDowell. But I'm also reading a lot of Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Geach, Iris Murdoch, Rosalind Hursthouse, Martha Nussbaum, and Michael Thompson, not to mention Talbot Brewer, Stephen R. Brown, and R. Scott Smith. 

My research explores the relation between virtue, practical rationality, and happiness. What exactly is a virtue and what is a vice? Is rationality a virtue? Is happiness just as “natural” as health – and what do we mean by ‘natural’ anyway? Answering these questions demands an analysis of what Foot calls "natural goodness" or natural function, and a serious dialogue with metaphysical naturalism. I suspect that a defense of "natural teleology" -- properly defined -- is a key to ethical theorizing and ethical living. 

Other problems that interest me are those in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, or philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community. 

I write some [other things, too](http://www.readingintentionally.com). Thanks for visiting my site. Please look around or [send me a note](emailto:keithedbuhler@gmail.com).
