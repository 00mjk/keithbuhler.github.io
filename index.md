I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Kentucky and a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. 

My research puts an Aristotelian form of virtue ethics in conversation with contemporary ethical and metaphysical naturalism. For example, I'm especially interested in critiques of modern moral philosophy and the attempt to provide a scientifically respectable articulation of the age-old view that virtue is 'natural.'  More broadly, I have a long-standing interest in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind, Plato, and philosophy of religion. 

I completed my PhD in philosophy under the direction of David Bradshaw. I also hold a master's degree in Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand and a bachelor's in Humanities from Biola University.

# Research

My primary research program stems from my [dissertation](/phd), titled "Becoming What We Are". That work defends Philippa Foot's ethical naturalism against John McDowell's, whose conception of nature is contradictory. I argue that virtue and especially practical wisdom are in an important sense *natural* for human beings and that the good life is the rational life.

One extension of that project puts Foot's "secular natural law theory" into conversation with religious theorists such as Mark Murphy and Tristram Englehardt.

Over the last 15 years, I've helped almost a thousand students of all ages to learn and grow. 

Folks tend to enjoy my classroom culture, which is suffused with humor and focused on real conversations about good books. They succeed academically and grow intellectually by reflecting on great books, film, art, and their own lives.
