I am currently a postdoc at the University of Kentucky, where I completed my PhD in philosophy in 2016. 

My primary research centers on virtue ethics. Specifically, I investigate concepts such as practical reason, nature, and 'natural reasoning.' For example, what does it mean to assert that virtue is 'natural' for human beings? Can ethical knowledge be (or be like) scientific knowledge? I address such questions in dialogue with both religious and secular thinkers. In addition to ethics, I have long-standing interests in philosophy of mind, Plato and Aristotle, and interdisciplinary interests in bioethics and the philosophy of biology. 

In the classroom, I've successfully helped learners to practice "the art of liberation" for more than 10 years at public research universities, private liberal arts universities, and classical high schools.
