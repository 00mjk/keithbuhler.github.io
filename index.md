I am a philosopher, classical educator, and writer. 

I'm currently a PhD candidate in philosophy at the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226) where I'm finishing a dissertation on contemporary analytic virtue ethics in writers such as Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre. 

For more than 8 years, I've successfully helped learners of all ages to grow and flourish by using immersive Socratic dialogue, great books, and humor. 

In my 45 minutes per month of spare time, I like to draw, sculpt, write fiction, and [compose lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) of what I do in my spare time.
