Keith Buhler is a philosopher and classical educator currently working at the University of Kentucky. He has been an educator for more than nine years, teaching high school, college, and lecturing publicly to all ages. His teaching interests span the curriculum, from Plato and Aristotle to contemporary film. 

His primary research provides a modern defense of the old concept that a good human life is a virtuous and rational life. More broadly, he investigates multiple themes in the history of philosophy and the philosophy of science where the split between facts and values holds sway. For example, does science have anything to contribute to ethics? And is ethics a science? Is virtue ethics religious ethics or can it be secular? 

Dr. Buhler completed his PhD in Philosophy at the University of Kentucky in 2016. He holds a Masters degrees in Orthodox Theology from the University of Lebanon.  His undergraduate studies were in Humanities (History) at the Torrey Honors Institute at Biola University.
