        I am currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Kentucky and a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. I have been [teaching](/teaching) for more than 15 years and love what I do. My [dissertation](/research) (which is coming along!) explicates some recent controversies in neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics, and offers a pretty thoroughgoing defense of the virtue theory of Philippa Foot.   &nbsp;&nbsp; My goal is not only to contribute to our discipline but to use philosophy as a means to human flourishing. This website hosts my [CV](/Buhler-CV), [sample syllabi](/teaching), [research interests](/research), plus a few other surprises. Students, [click here.](/philosophy) Others can check out my other online profiles: [UKY](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226);  [Phil Papers](http://philpapers.org/profile/47267); [Academia.edu](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler); [Rate My Professors](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771).
