I'm Keith Buhler, a PhD candidate in philosophy at the University of Kentucky and a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. I have been [teaching](/teaching) Socratically for more than 15 years and love what I do. My [dissertation](/research) defends a scientifically respectable version of neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism inspired by Philippa Foot. My philosophical goals are to contribute to our discipline, to flourish as a human being in community, and to invite students along as well.

This website hosts my [CV](/Buhler-CV), [sample syllabi](/teaching), [research interests](/research), plus a few other surprises.
