Hi, thanks for visiting. I am currently [**teaching** philosophy and ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and at the University of Kentucky. I have more  than 15 years of teaching [experience](/Buhler-CV) and really love what I do. 

I'm writing a [dissertation](/research) on virtue ethics. Specifically, I'm defending a neo-Aristotelian account of virtue ethics grounded in natural teleology. I analyze the debates between Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Rosalind Hursthouse, and Alasdair MacIntyre, and argue that [virtue](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/), practical reason, and happiness are intrinsically related concepts that must be understood in dynamic relation to each other.

I have competences in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, and philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community, and to help [**students**](/philosophy) do so as well.
