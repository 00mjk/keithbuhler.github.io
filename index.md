I'm Keith Buhler. I currently teach [philosophy, health care ethics, and virtue ethics](/teaching). at Asbury University and the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226). I've been teaching for about 14 years and really love what I do. Folks tend to [really like my classes.](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771) 

I'm also writing my [dissertation](/research) on virtue ethics. I also puzzle my way through problems in [metaphysics, philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, and philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler)

For fun, I [write some other things too](/fun/). My favorite pet project is [to help people read more books.](http://www.readingintentionally.com) Feel free to look around or send me a note. Thanks.
