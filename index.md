## Hi, Thanks for visiting.

I'm Keith Buhler. I currently teach [philosophy, health care ethics, and virtue ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and at the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226). I've been [teaching for about 14 years](/Buhler-CV) and really love what I do. Folks tend to [really like my classes.](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771) 

I'm also currently writing my [dissertation](/research) on virtue ethics. I'm  especially interested in the neo-Aristotelians (such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, and John McDowell) and their sometimes conflicting views of happiness and practical reason. I suspect that natural teleology is a key to ethics. When not thinking about such things, I'm usually puzzling about problems in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, or philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler)

For [fun](/fun/), I write some [other things, too](http://www.readingintentionally.com).
