This site is a guide to my personal interests and professional activities. 

As a philosopher and classical educator, my mission is to help people (in the classroom and out) to pursue virtue and wisdom. The tools to this end are teaching, coaching, and modeling the practical skills that bring about human flourishing. 

Achieving the high goal of human flourishing, and understanding its relation to each person's particular circumstances, is difficult. The pursuit requires identifying and fighting the many vices that so easily entangle; and it requires cultivating virtue in daily life. It requires pursuing wisdom tenaciously. 

Yet all these things are possible. 

Thank you for visiting. Check out my [current and recent projects](/projects),  [academic research](/research), or [the "Buhler Report" blog](/blog) for more interesting resources intended to enrich your journey.
