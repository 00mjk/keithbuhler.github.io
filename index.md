I am currently a philosophy instructor at Asbury University and a doctoral candidate at the University of Kentucky. 

My [dissertation](/research) research is on recent neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics (especiallly Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Alasdair MacIntyre). And my other philosophical interests include [Plato (especially the *Philebus*), hylomorphic metaphysics, religion, physicalism, and science.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) 

I have more than 15 years of [teaching](/teaching) [experience](/Buhler-CV) and love what I do.  My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community, and to help [students](/philosophy) do so as well. 

Thanks for visiting.
