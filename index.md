I'm Keith Buhler, a philosopher, classical teacher, and writer. I currently serve as a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Kentucky and a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. 

My scholarship contributes to contemporary virtue ethics. I provide a contemporary articulation and defense of the view that the good life is the virtuous and rational life.  

I completed my PhD in philosophy in 2017. I hold a master's degree in Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand and a BA in Humanities from Biola University.

# Teaching

![Teaching photo](http://www.keithbuhler.com/images/keith-teaching2.png)

For more than ten years, I've helped hundreds of students of all ages to grow intellectually by reflecting on great books, film, art, and their own lives. 

Students tend to enjoy my classrooms which are suffused with humor and focused on real conversations about good books.

# Research 

<img src="/images/possibleintellect.png" alt="dante-intellect" align="left" hspace="20" height="300" width="300">

My research interests tend to revolve around ethics and naturalism. 

My [dissertation](/phd), titled "Becoming What We Are", defends Philippa Foot's ethical naturalism against John McDowell's, whose conception of nature is contradictory. I argue that virtue and especially practical wisdom are in an important sense *natural* for human beings and that the good life is the rational life.

I also investigate related themes in metaethics and the philosophy of science such as the putative fact-value split. More broadly still, I have a long-standing interest in philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy (especially Plato), and philosophy of religion.

# About Me

*For other uses, see [Keith Buhler (disambiguation)](/disambiguation)*
<img src="/images/keith-josiah.jpg" alt="Keith and son" hspace="30px" align="right" width="50%"> 

My wife and I both hail from Southern California, so going to school in Kentucky is our first time living out of the country.  

We're also raising two toddlers, so I truly appreciate sleep. 

I was introduced to the great conversation and big ideas in college when my professors made me study history, literature, theology, and philosophy. It felt like touching a live wire. 

I began teaching great books in 2001 and have never really stopped.  My first class was discussing fairy tales with gifted 4th graders when I was just a sophomore in college. 

Philosophy is for me a profession and also a way of life. Even after teaching and researching all week, I preside over my local chapter of the American Chesterton Society to discuss literature, film, and politics with friends.

I have about 45 minutes of spare time per month. In that time, I like to draw things, sculpt clay, blog, tinker with web design, watch AFI Top 100 films, write fiction, and compose [lists of what I do in my spare time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)

Thanks for visiting.
