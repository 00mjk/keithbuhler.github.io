Thank you for visiting. This site is a guide to my personal interests and professional activities. 

My life mission is to help people of all ages to pursue virtue and wisdom.  The pursuit of wisdom informs my teaching, coaching, and other activites.  We *all* need to practice the practical skills that bring about human flourishing: growth in virtue, relational health, prayer and spiritual discipline. These practices require hard work and discipline but they are worth it. Virtue is possible.

For some helpful resources or more information, check out: 

* my [current projects](/projects);
* my [academic research](/research) to dialog about virtue; and
* [the "Buhler Report" blog](/blog) for recent reflections on all sundry of topics such as books, culture, movies, politics, and education. 



## About me

In my day job, I'm a philosopher and educator. Currently, I teach dual-credit philosophy courses at a [classical Christian school](https://classicalchristian.org/), and online philosophy courses for Asbury University. (I teach other courses as needed, such as: theology, history, Greek language, Spanish, and drama.)

I recently began a podcast: [Classical Academy Podcast](https://www.trinityclassicalacademy.com/about/news/podcast), which offers a friendly introduction to classical education for parents and fellow teachers in the movement. 

I serve as a board member of two other classical schools, and recently became an [Alcuin Fellow](http://www.alcuinfellowship.com/) (West Coast chapter). 



## Recent Activities

In December 2019, I'll be giving a free talk about health education in California public schools. 

I'm currently developing and implementing a [10th grade intro to philosophy course](http://www.keithbuhler.com/trinity-philosophy/). 

In 2018, I gave a lecture entitled ["Philosophy for Everyone" at Trinity Classical Academy,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMvlTUVFf4M&t=137s) introducing our community to the nature and value of philosophy.

## Prior activities

In the summer of 2018, I spoke at [the ACCS conference on "Assessing for Virtue".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovzMF-znsN8&t=2394s) and received positive feedback from the 120 teachers, admin, and parents in attendance.  

Around the same time I also had the privilege of [interviewing Dr. Robert George of Princeton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfDdJiyDnaY&t=10s) for my YouTube channel. 

Before that, I did audio interviews with [Eric Silverman, David Bradshaw, and JP Moreland.](http://www.advicetochristianphilosophers.com/)

In 2017, I defended my philosophy dissertation, titled [Becoming What We Are](/phd). It defends Aristotle's ethics in light of scientific naturalism -- and offers a tendentious definition of scientific naturalism. 

In 2012, I published a my first book, *Sola Scriptura*, a [Platonic dialogue](http://bitly.com/ScriptureOrTradition) consisting of of various Christians discussing Scripture and Tradition.
