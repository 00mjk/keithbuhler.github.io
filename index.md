I'm currently a PhD candidate in philosophy at the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226) and a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. 

For the last 8 years, I've been [introducing students](/teaching) in universities and classical high schools to the great conversation. I build an immersive environment of philosophical dialogue, motivating and empowering students to grow intellectually.  

My [research](/research) centers on neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism. I'm finishing up a dissertation on the writings of Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre -- mostly defending Foot. 

My philosophical goals are not only to contribute to our discipline, but to flourish as a human being in community and invite others along as well. Thanks for visiting.
