I'm Keith Buhler, a philosopher and classical educator. I currently hold positions as postdoc scholar at the University of Kentucky and philosophy instructor at Asbury University. 

For more than nine years, I've been helping students of all ages to grow intellectually by reflecting on great books, film, art, and their own lives.

My primary research in contemporary naturalism defends the notion that the good life is the virtuous and rational life. More broadly, I investigate themes in metaethics and the philosophy of science such as the putative split between facts and values. Does science have anything to contribute to ethics? Is ethics, in any real sense, a science? 

I completed my PhD in philosophy in 2017, and hold a master's degree in Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand. My BA is in Humanities from Biola University.
