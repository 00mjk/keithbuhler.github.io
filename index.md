I'm Keith Buhler, a philosopher, classical teacher, and writer. I currently serve as a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Kentucky and a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. 

My research focuses on ethical naturalism and virtue ethics. I'm especially interested in critiques of modern moral philosophy and the attempt to provide a contemporary articulation and defense of the age-old view that virtue is 'natural.'  In general, I'm interested in the dialog between naturalism and non-naturalism about normativity, nature, and mind. 

I defended my dissertation at the end of last year and received my PhD in 2017. I hold a master's degree in Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand and a BA in Humanities from Biola University.

# Teaching

![Teaching photo](http://www.keithbuhler.com/images/keith-teaching2.png)

Over the last 15 years, I've helped almost a thousand students of all ages. My students succeed academically and grow intellectually by reflecting on great books, film, art, and their own lives. Folks tend to enjoy my classroom culture, which is suffused with humor and focused on real conversations about good books.

# Research 

![wither](http://www.keithbuhler.com/images/wither.jpg)

My primary research program stems from my [dissertation](/phd), titled "Becoming What We Are". That work defends Philippa Foot's ethical naturalism against John McDowell's, whose conception of nature is contradictory. I argue that virtue and especially practical wisdom are in an important sense *natural* for human beings and that the good life is the rational life.

The current extension of that project puts Foot's "secular natural law theory" into conversation with religious theorists such as Mark Murphy and Tristram Englehardt. More broadly, I have a long-standing interest in metaphysics and philosophy of mind,  Plato, and philosophy of religion.

# Mini Bio

<img src="/images/keith-josiah.jpg" alt="Keith and son" hspace="30px" align="right" width="50%"> 

My wife and I both hail from Orange County, California, so going to school in Kentucky is our first time living out of the country.  

We're also raising two toddlers, so I truly appreciate sleep. 

I was introduced to the great conversation and big ideas in college when my professors made me study history, literature, theology, and philosophy. It felt like touching a live wire. 

I began teaching great books in 2001 and have never really stopped.  My first class was discussing fairy tales with gifted 4th graders when I was just a sophomore in college. 

Philosophy is for me a profession and also a way of life. Even after teaching and researching all week, I preside over my local chapter of the American Chesterton Society to discuss literature, film, and politics with friends.

I have about 45 minutes of spare time per month. In that time, I like to draw things, sculpt clay, blog, tinker with web design, watch AFI Top 100 films, write fiction, and compose [lists of what I do in my spare time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)
