### Hi! Thanks for visiting.

I currently teach [philosophy, health care ethics, and virtue ethics](/teaching). at Asbury University and the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226). I've been teaching for about 14 years and really love what I do. Folks tend to [really like my classes.](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771) 

I'm also writing my [dissertation](/fun/phd) on virtue ethics.  My research explores virtue, practical rationality, and happiness. What exactly is a virtue and what is a vice? Is rationality a virtue? Is happiness just as "natural" as health -- and what do we mean by 'natural' anyway?^[I'm especially interested in the neo-Aristotelians: Elizabeth Anscombe, Iris Murdoch, Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Rosalind Hursthouse, Martha Nussbaum, and Michael Thompson (among others).] I also puzzle my way through problems in [metaphysics, philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, and philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler)

For fun, I [write some other things too](/fun/). My favorite pet project is [to help people read more books.](http://www.readingintentionally.com)
