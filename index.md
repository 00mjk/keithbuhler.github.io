Keith Buhler is a philosopher and classical educator currently working at the University of Kentucky. He has been an educator for more than nine years, teaching both high school and college as well as speaking publicly. His teaching experience spans the curriculum, from Plato to contemporary film. 

His primary research provides a contemporary naturalistic defense of the notion that a good human life is a virtuous and rational life. More broadly, he investigates multiple themes in the history of philosophy and the philosophy of science that center on the putative split between facts and values. For example, does science have anything to contribute to ethics? And is ethics a science? Is virtue ethics religious ethics or can it be secular? 

Dr. Buhler completed his PhD in Philosophy at the University of Kentucky in 2016. He holds a Master's degree in Eastern Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand in Lebanon and a BA in Humanities at the Torrey Honors Institute at Biola University.
