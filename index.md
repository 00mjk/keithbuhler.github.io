## Welcome to keithbuhler.com

I am a philosopher and classical educator. My life's work is to help people in and out of the classroom by teaching, coaching, and modeling the practical skills that bring about human flourishing. 

The goal of human life is the cultivation of love and wisdom. Achieving this goal in each person's particular circumstances is difficult; it requires identifying and fighting the many vices that so easily entangle. It requires cultivating virtue in daily life. It requires pursuing wisdom tenaciously. 

My philosophical research centers on virtue, ethics, and naturalism. You can get to know my academic, professional, and personal activities or begin exploring some resources aimed at helping you become a more virtuous, wise, and loving person.

Thank you for visiting.
