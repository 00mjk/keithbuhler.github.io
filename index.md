I am currently a philosophy instructor Asbury University and ABD graduate student at the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226). I teach [introduction to philosophy, health care ethics, and virtue ethics](/teaching). Folks tend to [really like my classes.](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771) I have more than 14 years of experience teaching high school, college, and adults, and really love what I do. 

I'm also plugging away at my [dissertation](/phd) on virtue ethics under the advising of [David Bradshaw](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/dbradsh).  My research explores virtue, practical rationality, and happiness. What exactly is a virtue and what is a vice? Is rationality a virtue? Is happiness just as "natural" as health -- and what do we mean by 'natural' anyway? I'm especially interested in the neo-Aristotelians: Elizabeth Anscombe, Iris Murdoch, Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Rosalind Hursthouse, Martha Nussbaum, and Michael Thompson (among others). Although ethics is my primary focus right now, I'm also puzzling through problems in [metaphysics, philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, and philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler)

I [write some other things too](/fun stuff). My favorite pet project is [to help people read more books.](http://www.readingintentionally.com)
