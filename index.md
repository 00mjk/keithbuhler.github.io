I am currently a philosophy instructor at Asbury University and a doctoral candidate at the University of Kentucky. 

My [dissertation](/research) research is on recent neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics (Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Alasdair MacIntyre and more). I suspect that virtue cannot be defined apart from practical reason; and so whatever is true of practical reasoning will be true of virtue: practical reasoning is essential to human nature, practical reasoning is teleological, practical reasoning is both (obviously) intersubjective and (apparently) objective, and so on. These properties extend to moral virtues as well. 

My other philosophical interests include [Plato (especially *Philebus* and *Sophist*),  hylomorphic metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) 

I have more than 15 years of [teaching](/teaching) [experience](/Buhler-CV) and love what I do.  My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community, and to help [**students**](/philosophy) do so as well. 

Thanks for visiting.
