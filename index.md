I'm Keith Buhler, a PhD candidate in philosophy at the University of Kentucky and a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. I have been [teaching](/teaching) using classical, Socratic discussion methods for more than 15 years and love what I do. My [dissertation](/research) defends a version of neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics that is grounded in scientifically respectable natural normativity. My philosophical goals are to contribute to our discipline, to flourish as a human being in community, and to invite students along as well.

This website hosts my [CV](/Buhler-CV), [sample syllabi](/teaching), [research interests](/research), plus a few other surprises. Other online profiles: [University profile](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226);  [Academia.edu](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler); and [Rate My Professors](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771).
