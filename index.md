I am currently finishing up my doctorate in philosophy at the University of Kentucky. My research centers on virtue ethics and the dialogue between religion and naturalism.

I've been a full-time educator for more than eight years, where I've successfully helped learners of all ages to change and flourish. I use humor and immersive Socratic dialogue to create a friendly yet rigorous learning environment.
