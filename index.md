title: Anyone?... Buhler...?  

--- 

### Hi, I'm [Keith Buhler](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226)

<img src="/img/keithbuhler-golden.png" alt="Keith" align="left" hspace="20">

I currently [teach philosophy and ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and at the University of Kentucky. I've been an educator for about [14 years](/Buhler-CV) and [really love what I do.](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771) (Students, please visit the [philosophy portal](/philosophy).)

I’m also currently writing my [dissertation](/research) on virtue ethics. I’m especially interested in dialoging with neo-Aristotelians such as Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, and John McDowell. I suspect that a defense of "natural teleology" -- properly defined -- is a key to ethical theorizing.

Other problems that interest me are those in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, or philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community. 

Thanks for visiting; please explore or [send me a note](emailto:keithedbuhler@gmail.com).
