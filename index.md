I am currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Kentucky and a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. I have been [teaching](/teaching) for more than 15 years and love what I do. Philosophy is both a professional discipline and a means to human flourishing. My [dissertation](/research) explicates and defends a neo-Aristotelian virtue theory based on natural normativity. This website hosts my [CV](/Buhler-CV), [sample syllabi](/teaching), [research interests](/research), plus a few other surprises.
