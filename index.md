Hi, thanks for visiting. I am currently [**teaching** philosophy and ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and at the University of Kentucky. I have more  than 15 years of teaching [experience](/Buhler-CV) and really love what I do. 

I am conducting [dissertation **research**](/research) in virtue ethics, specifically the recent neo-Aristotelians such as Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre.[^1] My interest is in the relation between [virtue](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/), practical reason, and happiness.

I have competences in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, and philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community, and to help [**students**](/philosophy) do so as well. 

Other profiles: [University Kentucky,](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226) [PhilPapers,](http://philpapers.org/profile/47267) [Academia.edu,](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) and [RateMyProfessors.com](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771).

[^1]:As Rosalind Hursthouse explains: "The proponents of neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism (henceforth ``Aristotelian naturalism'' for short) include Foot (2001), Geach (1956, 1977), Hursthouse (1999), McDowell (1995), MacIntyre (1999), Nussbaum (1993, 1995), and Thompson (1995); and also Anscombe because her work has influenced so many others. (Gaut [1997, 2002] should also be known as a significant contributor.)"
