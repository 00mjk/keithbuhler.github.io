### Hi, I'm Keith Buhler

<img src="/img/keithbuhler-golden.png" alt="Keith" align="left" hspace="20">

I currently [teach philosophy and ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and at the University of Kentucky. I've been an educator for about [14 years](/Buhler-CV) and really love what I do. (Students, please visit the [philosophy portal](/philosophy).)

Iâ€™m in the thick of writing a [dissertation](/research) on virtue ethics. In it I argue for and against the neo-Aristotelian virtue ethicists such as Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, and John McDowell. I suspect that a successful defense of "natural teleology" -- properly defined -- is a key to ethical theorizing.

Other problems that interest me are those in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, or philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community.
