I'm currently a PhD candidate in philosophy at the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226) and a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. 

For the last 8 years, I've been [teaching](/teaching)  "Great Books" to students in universities and classical high schools. My goal is to build an immersive environment of philosophical thinking and to empower students to grow intellectually. 

My [research](/research) centers on virtue ethics. I'm finishing up a dissertation on neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism as it is represented in the writings of Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre. 

My philosophical goals are not only to contribute to our discipline, but to flourish as a human being in community and invite others along as well. Thanks for visiting.
