I am currently a postdoc at the University of Kentucky, where I completed my PhD in philosophy in 2016. 

I've been an educator for more than nine years. At public research universities, private liberal arts universities, and classical high schools, I've helped successfully helped learners of all ages, backgrounds, and beliefs to practice "the art of liberation." Reading ancient, medieval, modern, and contemporary works from a variety of disciplines helps us to transcend or our place and time and aim for timeless insights. 

My main research project attempts to find contemporary answers to ancient questions such as: what is a human being? What is a *good* human being? Is the happy life a rational life? Answering these primary questions requires rethinking the relation between facts and values, or between nature and normativity: does science have anything to contribute to ethics? Is ethics a science? To answer these questions, I dialogue with both religious and secular thinkers. I also have long-standing interests in philosophy of mind, Plato and Aristotle, and philosophy of religion.
