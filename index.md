### Hi, I'm Keith Buhler.

I am a philosopher, educator, researcher, and writer.

Thanks for visiting. This site introduces my professional work in philosophy. 

As an educator, I have more than 14 years experience with almost every grade level. I currently teach [philosophy and virtue ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and Health Care ethics at the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226). Folks tend to [really like my classes.](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771)

As a graduate student, I'm currently writing my [dissertation](/phd) on virtue ethics. My research explores concept of virtue and practical rationality. What are virtues and what are vices? Is the pursuit of virtue selfish? Is rationality a virtue? Is virtue natural -- and what do we mean by 'natural' anyway? I'm especially interested in the neo-Aristotelians: Elizabeth Anscombe, Iris Murdoch, Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Rosalind Hursthouse, Martha Nussbaum, and Michael Thompson (among others). 

As a researcher, although ethics is my primary focus, I often puzzle about problems in [metaphysics, philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, and philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler)

As a creator, I run the [Intentional Reading Project](http://www.readingintentionally.com) which aims helps people read more books, and [write other things too](/fun stuff) Feel free to explore this site or send me a note. Thanks,
