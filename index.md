## Hi, I'm Keith Buhler.

I am a philosopher, educator, researcher, and writer.

Currently, I teach philosophy and ethics at the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226) and [Asbury University](http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/regional-colleges-south). Folks tend to [really like my classes.](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771)

My dissertation research examines the concepts of virtue and practical reason in Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Robert Adams. I'm also interested in [metaphysics, philosophy of mind and imagination, and philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler)

When time permits, I write [fiction](http://circularreason.github.io/fiction). My blog helps others to [read intentionally.](http://www.readingintentionally.com)

This website is the start of a bigger project. In the meantime, enjoy.
