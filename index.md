I'm Keith Buhler, a philosopher, classical teacher, and writer. I currently hold positions as postdoc scholar at the University of Kentucky and philosophy instructor at Asbury University. 

My research contributes to contemporary virtue ethics. I provide a contemporary expression of the age-old view that the good life is the rational and virtuous life.  

I completed my PhD in philosophy in 2017, and hold a master's degree in Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand. My BA is in Humanities from Biola University.

# Research 

<img src="/images/possibleintellect.png" alt="dante-intellect" align="left" hspace="20" height="300" width="300">

My research interests tend to revolve around ethics and naturalism. 

My [dissertation](/phd), titled "Becoming What We Are", defends Philippa Foot's ethical naturalism against John McDowell's. I argue that virtue and especially practical wisdom are in an important sense *natural* for human beings and that the good life is the rational life.

I also investigate related themes in metaethics and the philosophy of science such as the putative fact-value split. Does science have anything to contribute to ethics? Is ethics, in any real sense, a science? 

More broadly, I have a long-standing interest in philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy (especially Plato), and philosophy of religion.

# Teaching

For more than ten years, I've helped hundreds of students of all ages to grow intellectually by reflecting on great books, film, art, and their own lives. 

Students tend to enjoy my classrooms which are focused on good books, real conversations, and suffused with humor.

# About Keith

<img src="/images/keith-josiah.jpg" alt="Keith and son" hspace="30px" align="right" width="50%"> 

My wife and I both hail from Southern California, so going to school in Kentucky is our first time living out of the country.  

We're also raising two toddlers, so I truly love sleep. 

I was introduced to the great conversation and big ideas in college when my professors made me study history, literature, theology, and philosophy. It felt like touching a live wire. 

I began teaching junior great books to gifted 4th graders when I was just a sophomore in college and have never really stopped.

Philosophy is for me a profession and also a way of life. Even after teaching and researching all week, I preside over my local chapter of the American Chesterton Society to discuss literature, film, and politics with friends.

I have about 45 minutes of spare time per month. In that time, I like to draw things, sculpt clay, blog, write fiction, and compose [lists of what I do in my spare time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)

Thanks for visiting.
