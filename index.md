Hi, thanks for visiting. I am currently [**teaching** philosophy and ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and at the University of Kentucky. My [CV](/Buhler-CV) shows 14 years of teaching experience, and I really love what I do. 

Iâ€™m in the thick of [dissertation **research**](/research) on the virtue ethics of Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, and John McDowell. My research explores the relation between virtue, practical rationality, and happiness. I suspect that a defense of "natural teleology" -- properly defined -- is a key to ethical theorizing and ethical living. 

Other problems that interest me are those in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, or philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community, and to help [**students**](/philosophy) do so as well.
