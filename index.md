I am currently an instructor of philosophy at Asbury University. In 2016, I earned my PhD in philosophy from the University of Kentucky, where I also serve as a teaching postdoc.  

My primary research centers on virtue ethics, practical reason, and the concept of 'nature.' For example, what does it mean to assert that virtue is 'natural' for human beings? Is such an assertion 'scientific'? I address such questions in dialogue with both religious and secular thinkers. In addition to ethics, I have a long-standing interest in philosophy of mind as well as interdisciplinary interests in bioethics and the philosophy of biology. 

In the classroom, I've successfully helped learners to practice "the art of liberation" for more than 10 years at public research universities, private liberal arts universities, and high schools.
