This site is a guide to my personal interests and professional activities. 

Thank you for visiting. Check out my [current projects](/projects),  [academic research](/research), or [the "Buhler Report" blog](/blog) for more interesting resources intended to enrich your journey. 


## About me

I'm a philosopher and classical educator, and the host of the [Classical Academy Podcast.](https://www.trinityclassicalacademy.com/about/news/podcast)  I am a West Coast Alcuin Fellow and serve on the advisory board of two classical schools. 

My mission is to help people of all ages to pursue virtue and wisdom. 

That mission guides my teaching, coaching, and personal life. We all need to practice the practical skills that bring about human flourishing: personal growth, relational health, prayer and spiritual discipline.

Achieving the high goal of human flourishing, and understanding its relation to each person's particular circumstances, is difficult. 

The pursuit requires identifying and fighting the many vices that so easily entangle; and it requires cultivating virtue in daily life. It requires pursuing wisdom tenaciously. 

Yet all these things are possible. 



## Recent Activities

In December 2019, I'll be giving a free talk (open to the public) about sex and health education in CA. 

While teaching philosophy at a classical school, I've been developing a [10th grade intro to philosophy course](http://www.keithbuhler.com/trinity-philosophy/). 



In 2018, I spoke at Trinity Classical Academy, introducing our community to the nature and value of philosophy. The talk is titled "Philosophy For Everyone".

## Prior activities

In the summer of 2018, I spoke at [the ACCS conference on "Assessing for Virtue".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovzMF-znsN8&t=2394s) and received positive feedback from the 120 or so in attendance.  

Around the same time I also had the privilege of [interviewing Dr. Robert George of Princeton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfDdJiyDnaY&t=10s) for my YouTube channel. Before that, I did audio interviews with [Eric Silverman, David Bradshaw, and JP Moreland.](http://www.advicetochristianphilosophers.com/)


In 2017, I defended my philosophy dissertation, titled [Becoming What We Are](/phd). It defends Aristotle's ethics in light of scientific naturalism and offers a tendentious definition of scientific naturalism. 

In 2012, I published a my first book, *Sola Scriptura*, a [Platonic dialogue](http://bitly.com/ScriptureOrTradition) consisting of of various Christians discussing Scripture and Tradition.
