Hi, thanks for visiting. I am currently [**teaching** philosophy and ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and at the University of Kentucky. I have more than 15 years of teaching [experience](/Buhler-CV) and love what I do. 

I'm writing a [dissertation](/research) on virtue ethics. I analyze the debates between Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Rosalind Hursthouse, and Alasdair MacIntyre, and argue that [virtue](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/), practical reason, and flourishing are intrinsically related concepts that must be understood in dynamic relation to each other. Specifically, I'm defending a neo-Aristotelian account according to which natural teleology explains both what moral and intellectual virtues are and why we have an obligation to acquire virtues. 

My other interest include [philosophy of mind, metaphysics, ancient philosophy, and philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community, and to help [**students**](/philosophy) do so as well.
