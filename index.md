## Hi, I'm Keith Buhler.

I'm a philosopher, educator, researcher, and writer.

15 years ago, I began teaching the "great books" to children. Since then, I have taught philosophy, history, and literature to college students, high school, and adults. Currently, I teach philosophy and ethics at the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226) and [Asbury University](http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/regional-colleges-south). Folks tend to [really like my classes.](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771)

My dissertation research examines the concepts of virtue and practical reason in Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Robert Adams. I'm also interested in [metaphysics, philosophy of mind and imagination, and philosophy of religion..](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler)

When time permits, I write [fiction](/fiction). I help others to [read intentionally.](http://www.readingintentionally.com)

This website is the start of a bigger project. In the meantime, enjoy.
