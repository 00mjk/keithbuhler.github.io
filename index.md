I am currently an instructor of philosophy at the University of Kentucky and Asbury University. I earned my PhD in philosophy from the University of Kentucky in 2016. My research centers on virtue ethics, practical reason, and the concept of 'nature.' For example, is it true that virtue is natural for human beings? Is this a scientific statement? I address such questions in dialogue with both religious and secular thinkers.  

Philosophy is one of the last liberal arts. In the classroom, I've successfully helped learners to practice "the art of liberation" for more than 10 years at public research universities, private liberal arts universities, as well as high school.
