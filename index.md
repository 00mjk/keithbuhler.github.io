## Hi, Thanks for visiting.

I'm Keith Buhler. I currently teach [philosophy, health care ethics, and virtue ethics](/teaching) at Asbury University and at the [University of Kentucky](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/kebu226). I've been [teaching](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1822771) ) for about [14 years](/Buhler-CV) and really love what I do.

I'm also currently writing my [dissertation](/research) on virtue ethics. I'm  especially interested in the neo-Aristotelians (such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, and John McDowell) and their sometimes conflicting views of happiness and practical reason. I suspect that natural teleology is a key to ethics. Other problems that interest me are those in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, or philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler)


I write some [other things, too](http://www.readingintentionally.com). Thanks for visiting my site. Please look around or [send me a note](emailto:keithedbuhler@gmail.com).
