The content and style of this site was created by Keith Buhler.   

I start by writing posts and pages in plain text with simple [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) mark up. 

A wonderful software called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) transforms the plain text files into HTML. The source HTML is *stored* on my hard-drive, but it's *hosted* for free by [Github](http://www.github.com). 

The CSS files and site structure are modifications of the beautiful [Minimal Mistakes Layout](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) from New York designer Michael Rose.

To make your own similar website would take some work, especially if you have zero programming experience. But you can do it. Start [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Or you could [hire me to make one for you.](/sites)
