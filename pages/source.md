The content and style of this site was created by Keith Buhler -- with the help of [Dan Sheffler](http://www.dansheffler.com/), Jekyll, Michael Rose, [W3Schools](www.w3schools.com) and the good folks at [Github](https://github.com).

The CSS design consists of modified version of the beautiful [Minimal Mistakes Layout](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) by New York designer [Michael Rose.](https://mademistakes.com/) The content is written in plain text [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and stored on my hard-drive. 

When it's ready to publish, an amazing software called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) transforms the plain text files into HTML which is  *hosted* and published for free by Github. Amazing, right?

If you know programming, you can make your own similar website easily, over which you have total control. If you have zero programming experience, but you are tech-curious, you can do it. It will take some work. Start [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). (Alternately, I could [make yours for you.](/sites))
