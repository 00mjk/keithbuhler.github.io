The content and style of this site was created by Keith Buhler with [Jekyll.](https://jekyllrb.com/)  You can view the source code [here.](github.com/keithbuhler/keithbuhler.github.io)
 
The source HTML is *stored* on my hard-drive, but it's *hosted* for free by an open-source community called [Github](http://www.github.com). 

I start by writing in a simple programming language called [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  Jekyll then converts these plain text Markdown files to HTML and publishes them to the web.
