### Introduction

There is a growing trend -- and a positive trend, in my view -- of making explicit how web sites collect and use information of their visitors.[^1] I want to ensure that my readers feel as safe as possible and the information below is full disclosure on what happens on keithbuhler.com

Rest assured that **I will never share your information or email with anyone else.**

### Log Files

Like many other websites, keithbuhler.com uses log files to help learn about when, from where and how often traffic flows to this site. The information in the log files include:


Internet Protocol addresses (IP)  
Types of browser  
Internet Service Provider (ISP)  
Date and time stamp  
Referring and exit pages  
Number of clicks  


None of this type of information is linked to anything that is personally identifiable.

## Cookies and web beacons

Like nearly all Websites, keithbuhler.com may store cookies on your computer. These collect information but I have no access or control over them. To disable cookies, use your browser's settings. 

### Amazon Affiliates

Amazon, a third party affiliate marketing network, uses cookies to help make sure I get a commission when you buy a product after clicking on a link or ad banner that takes you to the site of one of their merchants. You can read [Amazon’s Privacy Policy.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496)

>keithbuhler.com is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com, amazonsupply.com, or myhabit.com.

I am an "Amazon Affiliate" which means I earn a very small commission on products you buy on Amazon.com after entering through [any of my pages](http://amzn.to/2hIJTol). Amazon offers these commissions in exchange for sites like myself to advertise for them and drive traffic to their market. These commissions are very small (usually around 3%) but they can accumulate and help me to feed my family and continue providing you content. 

Furthermore, these small commissions *never* cost you any extra money, and I will never recommend a product just to make a sale. I only link to products (mostly books) that I have read and honestly enjoy and commend to your interest. 

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a web analytics tool I use to help understand how visitors engage with this website. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors. You can read [Google Analytics Privacy Policy.](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245)

### Google Site Stats

To measure performance, Google uses small strings of text (known as cookies) that are placed on your computer when you click on ads. Cookies typically remain active on your computer for about 30 days. If you visit certain pages of the advertiser’s website during that period, Google and the advertiser will be able to tell that you saw the ad delivered by Google. You can read more about [Google Site Stats here.](https://services.google.com/sitestats/en_US.html?cid=1060759437)

### MailChimp

Subscribers may choose to receive email updates via MailChimp by submitting an email address to the email subscription form. I use a secure opt-in subscription system and I reserve the right to contact subscribers with information related to this website and blog. Subscribers may unsubscribe anytime and every email delivered will contain an “Unsubscribe” link.

Thank you for reading.
