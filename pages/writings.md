This part of my [Fun Stuff](http://www.keithbuhler.com/fun/) site captures a few of my articles, short stories, fairy tales, screenplays, poems, and satire. Hope you enjoy. 

I am a devout amateur: I believe that everyone should create, write, draw, sculpt, code, or what have you -- even if they can't or don't make a living at it. Just create. 

My writings have been published in print and online. But I will continue to write even if I never get published again. 

Right now, I'm taking a break from such things to write my [dissertation](/phd). Hopefully one day soon I will get back to it.
