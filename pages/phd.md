### INTRODUCTION

Brian Tracy says you eat an elephant one bite at a time. Writing a dissertation is like that. If you like a challenge, it can be fun.  You can read the story of how I approached this massive project [here.](/phd-how-to)


### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I am sincerely grateful to Dr. David Bradshaw for being my advisor on this project. He was not only a professor but a model of virtue and practical wisdom. I am also grateful for the early encouragement of friends and family members such as Kristi Buhler, who first taught me to dream big, and John Mark Reynolds, who first told me I was a philosopher. Alfred Geier, whom students have characterized as "Zeus in human form," mentored me in philosophical dialogue, while Gary Hartenburg's invaluable feedback helped me transition into graduate school. Timothy Sundell first pushed me toward serious research in metaethics, and Anita Superson helped with early and tough criticism of my project. I am especially grateful to Stefan Bird-Pollan and Dan Breazeale  for saving the day and serving on my committee last minute. Once I began writing in earnest, Lindsay Buhler was the first to read and edit each chapter. Even before a chapter was written, she played the role of Socratic midwife, testing each new idea to see if it was viable or only a "wind egg." Michael Garten was the last to read and edit each chapter, providing incisive objections I can only hope I have adequately overcome. Great strides in the construction of this dissertation would have been impossible without the very practical help of a few others: Dan Sheffler trained me, like his father trained him, in the ways of formatting in Markdown and LaTeX. Also, the University of Kentucky Graduate School hosted a writing boot camp to help folks like me to write intensively for two weeks. Eric Peterson was not only a fellow companion in graduate school but a friend and source of encouragement. Finally, the United Way of the Blue Grass generously donated tuition dollars, books, and the laptop computer on which I wrote this dissertation.  These people, and more whom I forgot to name, helped bring this project to fruition. My late father, Dr. Rich Buhler, received two honorary doctorates for his work in radio. I recently found out that he told others (when I had just started college) that he suspected I would be his first child to receive an earned doctorate. I was happy to learn this; I am even happier now to justify his suspicion. 


### TITLE

BECOMING WHAT WE ARE: VIRTUE AND PRACTICAL WISDOM AS NATURAL ENDS IN RECENT NEO-ARISTOTELIANISM


### ABSTRACT 

ABSTRACT: This dissertation is about ethical naturalism. I defend and bolster Philippa Foot’s sort of neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism against that of John McDowell. Foot and McDowell are united in the affirmation that virtue is ‘natural goodness’ for human beings. They are also united in endorsing scientific naturalism. Nevertheless, they are divided in their rival conceptions of ‘nature.’ McDowell distinguishes “second nature” or the “space of reasons” from “first nature” or the “realm of law.” Foot rejects this division. Even though human practical reasoning is unique in the biological world, she argues that natural goodness is a just as much a feature of “first nature” as life and health. The human goods of excellent practical reasoning and virtuous living are of a piece with other natural goods such as health and well-functioning. I defend Foot’s view by appealing to “generic propositions,” a little-utilized feature of linguistic theory. Generic life forms and organic functions are just as scientifically respectable as other naturalistic concepts. I then argue that human beings are best understood as practical, rational primates. It follows that the ethical and rational norms defining a good human life are a subset of natural norms which can be known as such from an “external” scientific point of view as well as from an “internal” ethical point of view. In short, I argue that virtue and practical wisdom are natural ends for human beings. All of us ought to pursue them because of who and what we are, despite varying abilities and life circumstances. I then go beyond Foot’s view to articulate neo-Aristotelian accounts of virtue and practical reason. While the normative force of my thesis is clear, I aim to secure its naturalistic credentials by examining three influential conceptions of ‘nature.’ I criticize McDowell’s conception, and show how my view is consistent with either of the remaining two. I call my view “recursive naturalism,” for practical reason- ing, which is natural to human beings, is part of the natural world even though we reason about the world, ourselves, and our own reasoning.
