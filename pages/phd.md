### INTRODUCTION

Brian Tracy says you eat an elephant one bite at a time. Writing a dissertation is like that. If you like a challenge, it can be fun.  You can read the story of how I approached this massive project [here.](/phd-how-to)


### TITLE

BECOMING WHAT WE ARE: VIRTUE AND PRACTICAL WISDOM AS NATURAL ENDS IN RECENT NEO-ARISTOTELIANISM


### ABSTRACT 

Foot and McDowell are united in the affirmation that virtue is 'natural goodness' for human beings and they are even united in endorsing scientific naturalism.  Nevertheless, they are divided in endorsing rival conceptions of 'the natural.' McDowell divides "second nature" from  "first nature", while Foot rejects this division. McDowell divides the normative space of reasons and values from the descriptive realm of facts and laws while Foot argues that natural goodness is a feature of first nature. In other words, norms of practical reasoning are of a piece with organic norms of life, health, and well-functioning. I defend Foot's view and augment it by presenting interlocking accounts of virtue, practical reason, human nature, and nature itself. First, I contend that some natural norms are just as scientifically respectable as generic life forms such as 'the wolf' and generic activities such as 'hunting in packs.' Secondly, I argue that human beings are practical, rational primates and part of the same organic world. It follows, thirdly, that ethical  norms and natural reasons defining a good human life are a subset of natural norms. The good life for human beings is one spent pursuing virtue and practical wisdom. This can be known both from an "external" scientific view of human beings and from an "internal" ethical view of ourselves. Finally, to secure the naturalistic credentials of my view, I articulate three influential conceptions of 'nature,' criticize McDowell's conception, and show how my view is consistent with either of the remaining two. On my view, which I call "recursive naturalism," practical reasoning is natural to human beings and human beings are part of the natural world even though we reason about the world, ourselves, and our own reasoning.
