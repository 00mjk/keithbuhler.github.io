### TITLE

BECOMING WHAT WE ARE: VIRTUE AND PRACTICAL WISDOM AS NATURAL ENDS IN RECENT NEO-ARISTOTELIANISM


### ABSTRACT 

This dissertation is about ethical naturalism. I clarify and defend Philippa Foot's sort of neo-Aristotelian naturalism against John McDowell's sort. Foot and McDowell agree that virtue and excellent practical reasoning are 'natural goodness' for human beings; they disagree in their conceptions of 'nature' or 'the natural.' They are both scientific naturalists of a sort, but McDowell divides "second nature" from the "first nature", the normative space of reasons and values from the descriptive realm of facts and laws. Foot rejects this division. Natural goodness is a feature of first nature, and that the norms of virtue and practical reasoning are of a piece with the organic norms of life, health, and well-functioning. I defend Foot's view and augment it by presenting interlocking accounts of virtue, practical reason, human nature, and nature itself. I contend that some natural norms are just as scientifically respectable as generic life forms such as 'the wolf' and generic activities such as 'hunting in packs.' Hence, I argue that since  human beings are practical, rational primates and part of the same organic world, a subset of natural norms are ethical or rational norms governing a good human life. The good life, spent pursuing virtue and practical wisdom, can be known from both an "external" scientific view of ourselves and an "internal" ethical view. The normativity of my claim is clear; to bolster its naturalistic credentials, I explore three influential conceptions of 'nature'. I criticize McDowell's conception, and show how my account is consistent with either of the remaining two. On my view, which I call "recursive naturalism," practical reasoning is natural to human beings and human beings are part of the natural world even though we reason about the world, ourselves, and our own reasoning.
