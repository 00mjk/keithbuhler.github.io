### TITLE

BECOMING WHAT WE ARE: VIRTUE AND PRACTICAL WISDOM AS NATURAL ENDS IN RECENT NEO-ARISTOTELIANISM


### ABSTRACT 

This dissertation is about ethical naturalism. I defend and bolster Philippa Foot's sort of neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism against that of John McDowell. Foot and McDowell are united in the affirmation that virtue is 'natural goodness' for human beings. They are also united in endorsing scientific naturalism.  Nevertheless, they are divided in their rival conceptions of 'nature.' McDowell distinguishes "second nature" or the "space of reasons" from  "first nature" or the "realm of law." Foot rejects this division. Even though human practical reasoning is unique in the biological world, she argues that natural goodness is a just as much a feature of "first nature" as life and health. The human goods of excellent practical reasoning and virtuous living are of a piece with other natural goods such as health and well-functioning. I defend Foot's view by appealing to "generic propositions," a little-utilized feature of linguistic theory. Generic life forms and organic functions are just as scientifically respectable as other naturalistic concepts. I then argue that human beings are best understood as practical, rational primates. It follows that the ethical and rational norms defining a good human life are a subset of natural norms which can be known as such from an "external" scientific point of view as well as from an "internal" ethical point of view. In short, I argue that virtue and  practical wisdom are natural ends for human beings. All of us ought to pursue them because of who and what we are, despite varying abilities and life circumstances. I then go beyond Foot's view to articulate neo-Aristotelian accounts of virtue and practical reason. While the normative force of my thesis is clear, I aim to secure its naturalistic credentials by examining three influential conceptions of 'nature.' I  criticize McDowell's conception, and show how my view is consistent with either of the remaining two. I call my view "recursive naturalism," for practical reasoning, which is natural to human beings, is part of the natural world even though we reason about the world, ourselves, and our own reasoning.
