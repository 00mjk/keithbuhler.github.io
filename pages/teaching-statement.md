## Teaching Statement

My primary pedagogical goal is to create a learning culture that enables students to grow in virtue and wisdom.  Being a full-time educator for more than nine years  has enabled me to hone strategies that are effective for students of virtually all backgrounds, religions, ages, and aptitudes.

### Disputation Papers

Philosophical inquiry begins and ends with good arguments. Therefore, my courses are exercises in understanding, critiquing, and producing arguments. 

One tool that has worked well for me is assigning philosophical papers in a classic "disputation" format. I pose a clear, yes/no question for students to answer. They state their thesis, list objections to their own view, and then argue for their view before rebutting objections. The disputation format not only requires argumentative clarity and brevity but inculcates the virtues of epistemic humility and charity while presenting of one's opponent's view.  To my surprise, these disputation papers are the single best-reviewed assignment I give. One medical ethics student wrote: "I loved writing the papers. It helped me look past the surface and see my true position on each subject/topic." (PHL200 2015) Students have even asked me to assign *more* such papers(!) 

### Inspiration

Rigorous argument is new and challenging for many students. Therefore, my courses aim to inspire students with the many personal and academic benefits of philosophical reasoning. 

One motto that I have found useful in the classroom is this: "demand everything; forgive anything." This motto indicates the paradox that students need to be challenged but they also need kindness when they face various struggles such as poor health, personal and family issues, or socio-economic and other disadvantages.  I've found that a combination of clear goals and unlimited patience is very effective in spurring high-performing students to go grow while encouraging students who enjoy fewer advantages to excel beyond what they might have imagined.  

### Making Learning Enjoyable

The first day is crucial for setting expectations.  I promise students that I will make the course as enjoyable as possible, and ask in return that they take responsibility for their own learning. 

I use humor and a personable approach to conversation to keep the classroom environment fun, even when the work is difficult. Epicurus argued the virtuous life is the most pleasant life, so we try to enjoy acquiring virtue. One student reported: "The course was really interesting, and the teacher was very engaging. I expected this gen-ed to not be fun, but he made it interesting, fun, and I learned a lot about how to think differently about things." (Asbury, Intro to Philosophy, 2015)


### Introductory Course Strategies

Introductory classes are an opportunity to show students the benefits of a philosophy major or minor. In week 3, I present a verbal and written case for majoring in philosophy. By the end of the semester, I tend to recruit approximately 1-2 philosophy majors per 30 student class. For example, one student switched her major from music to philosophy after taking my virtue ethics course. She did not *think of herself* as a "philosopher" -- but realized in that course that philosophy would not only be more challenging but could help her become a better writer and musician. 

Introductory classes are primarily a chance to invite students to become more self-reflective thinkers who know themselves within their context of history, tradition, and culture. To this end, I assign  mostly primary sources (such as Plato, Augustine, and Hume) and coach students and how to read well, take notes, and discuss well. Thematic focus is eclectic (including Socratic wisdom, the soul, the problem of evil, existence of God, scientific reasoning, skepticism). For a change of pace and to reduce workload at midterm and finals, we also watch and analyze films such as the Matrix, Toy Story 3, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the Tree of Life. 

Class time is 2/3rds interactive lecture, usually following a slide show that is available online before, during, and after class. The remaining 1/3rd of class time is teacher-lead discussion that accustoms students to the normal aporetic feelings of confusion and vertigo that come from doing hard philosophical work. In lectures and discussions, I aim to help students follow the argument and gain insight into these timeless topics.

Another technique that has worked well for me is to allow students two tracks for earning participation points: "Internal processors" post weekly on a Wiki discussion board while "external processors" speak in class. This allows external processors to talk more in class and encourages internal processors to articulate their thoughts in writing. One characteristic comment from a student: “I have a tough time thinking outside the box in a philosophical manner so this course really challenged me. I am grateful that the internal/external processor idea was put into action because I freak out if I have to talk in front of the class.” (2015) 

### Upper Division Course Strategies

Upper division courses are slightly different. I make the pitch for earning a philosophy minor, and include a broader range of contemporary sources. Class time is  1/3rd interactive lecture, with 2/3rds cooperative discussion and student presentations. 

I assign upper division students to complete "Critical Readings." They meet in groups ahead of time to collaboratively interpret the reading for the day, answering six specific questions such as 'what is the author's thesis?', 'what is the main argument?', 'what are the main objections?' and so on. The group presents its Critical Reading results and kicks off the discussion. Students appreciate that all my assignments require and reward philosophical thinking. One student said:  “None of the assignments are busy work." (Asbury 2014) 

### Results

Students consistently report enjoying my classes and oftentimes choose to study more philosophy. On my RateMyProfessors.com profile, the three most common descriptions students have chosen are "hilarious" and "inspirational" and "participation matters."

Nevertheless, every semester I learn something new and slowly improve teaching techniques. For example, my first year of teaching, I required *everyone* to speak in class to earn participation points. Students complained that the class was "geared toward external processors" so I changed this requirement. I am always experimenting with creative ways to elicit student participation in the immersive work pursuing virtue and wisdom.






## Discursive Evaluations 

In addition to numerical data, Asbury and the University of Kentucky allow students to write a purely *qualitative* analysis on the course and the instructor. These come in the form of anonymous comments. The following are a representative selection of comments from the same five courses, organized by theme. Complete evaluations are available upon request. 


### Lectures

- "This professor is passionate about what he teaches his students, and is really good at keeping the class engaged. He is very knowledgeable." (2015, PHL200)
- "Keep drawing on the board! I'm a visual learner and your drawings are very helpful." (PHI305)
- "I liked the way that he challenged our views on life and the fundamental concepts of everything." (Asbury 2014)


### Making Learning Enjoyable

- Very funny and tried to crack a lot of jokes. Also, full of energy for an 8AM.(PHL200 2016)
- "The course was really interesting, and the teacher was very engaging. I expected this gen-ed to not be fun, but he made it interesting, fun, and I learned a lot about how to think differently about things."(2015, PHL200)


### Classroom Culture

- "Instructor made the course. Great environment to learn and discuss-made the classroom a comfortable place to share ideas and grow in knowledge. One of my favorite professors." (Asbury 2015)
- "Buhler is a fantastic teacher. He is very theatrical about philosophy which is great. He treats us like adults and enjoys discussion. He really brings out the best about philosophy. None of his assignments are busy work. He learned our names very quickly and took time to understand our points in discussion. He is very knowledgeable about many things and has a very open view to discussion." (UK 2015)

### Discussion

- "Very engaging teaching style. Allowed a lot of room for class discussion providing a fun and engaging learning environment."(Asbury 2016)
- "I loved the class discussions. Buhler always encouraged in class discussions and cared about us as people."(Asbury 2016)
- "I enjoyed pretty much every aspect of the class. I really liked that I was able to process on my own and post about it since I hate talking in class. I also liked that even though I generally don't like to, I never felt too intimidated to speak when I wanted to because the environment was so friendly and conductive to learning and participation." (UK 2015)

### Internal Processors 

- "Allowed different means of participation. Rather than making each student participate out loud in class, he provided ways for different types of learners to meet that portion of their grade. He made a fun learning environment. He did not treat us like we are in high school, he treated us like adults and like college students should be treated. He realized that we are capable of making decisions for ourselves and that we are responsible for ourselves. He respected us as students." (Asbury 2015)
- "I have a tough time thinking outside the box in a philosophical manner so this course really challenged me. I am grateful that the internal/external processor idea was put into action because I freak out if I have to talk in front of the class." (Asbury 2015)

### No Busy work
- "Many of the texts were very interesting. I appreciate that the Prof. Buhler understood the struggle of learning Philosophy at 8:00 in the morning."(Asbury 2016)
- "The vast majority was discussion driven. Most other Philosophy classes I hear of are filled with terms, theories, and endless quizzes. This class was focused on having the class externally or internally process the topics we went over. The reading in the course was not some impersonal textbook with dates, names, and definitions. We read the words of actual philosophers." (Asbury 2015)
- "I enjoyed that the main focus of this course was not about the grade, but more outlined on learning and understanding ethical concepts and formulating your own opinion on them." (UK 2016)

### Gratuitous Praise

- "Mr. Buhler is probably the best Prof I have ever had. He has a genuine interest in the student and spends time outside of class and office hours with students to help them succeed. He is not only interested in producing excellent students, but excellent human beings. He provokes thought and helps students to reach new places of understanding. Mr. Buhler is excellent." (Asbury 2015)
- "Prof Buhler was an incredible teacher. I have a tough time thinking outside the box in a philosophical manner so this course really challenged me. I am grateful that the internal/external processor idea was put into action because I freak out if I have to talk in front of the class. I wish I hadn't been so sick this semester though because I got a lot more out of actually going to class than I did doing things on my own. I might not have enjoyed participating in the discussion, but I've always been more of an observer anyways and the things that students said really intrigued me and forced me to think."
- "Prof. Buhler is really great. I have been recommending the course and him to all my friends. Honestly, this course was the one this semester that I enjoyed going to the most and got the most out of. And maybe while I didn't quite show it, every class period left me with more questions about our world and left me with a feeling like I was understanding things in a new light. Honestly, I wish Prof. Buhler would teach all of my classes here are Asbury. Even if he didn't know the subject matter, I would still come for the jokes, and doodles on the board, and the overall pleasantness he brings to the classroom."
- "One of my favorite professors at Asbury, Buhler makes learning philosophy so inspiring, challenging and exciting. He has encouraged me through class discussions and personal one-on-one time in the pursuit of a deeper understanding of wisdom, faith, maturity and (of course) humor. I would not be the same person I am today without his leadership."


### Faculty Evaluations

Separately included are teaching letters of recommendation. One is  from Chris Bounds, the Chair of the Philosophy and Religion Department at Asbury University, who has observed my interactions with students in and out of class. Another is from John Mark Reynolds, the President of The Saint Constantine School and Senior Fellow of Humanities at The King's College in New York City, for whom I have worked in various capacities over the years; another is from Brandon Look, the Chair of the Philosophy Department at the University of Kentucky.

In addition, below is a comment from a faculty observer:

>*Dan Breazeale, University of Kentucky:*
>"The day I visited much of the class was devoted to introducing the concept of "moral philosophy". (And the rest of the class was devoted to explaining what was involved in the assigned "group presentations.") Dance tractor with enthusiastic and personable, with copious humorous ad libs, to which the students responded positively. His remarks were clear and precise and appeared to be helpful the 31 students were present in the packed classroom (and who paid attention to the instructor for the entire class period). Good use of powerpoint slides and successful effort to engage students in class discussion." 



## Teaching Interests

I am interested in teaching courses similar to those already given, and in expanding my repertoire to include interdisciplinary courses in religion, political science, and philosophy of biology. I am capable of teaching advanced courses in the history of philosophy and philosophy of mind. For example, I have extensive experience with ancient Greek philosophy and I am developing a course spanning the pre-Socratics to the Stoics, with special emphasis on Plato and Aristotle. I am also developing a course comparing physicalism, dualism, and hylomorphism in philosophy of mind.
