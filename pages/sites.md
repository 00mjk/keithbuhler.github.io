Do you need an academic website? [Hire me!](emailto:info@keithbuhler.com)

## Design

You have three options: 

(a) You can pick one of these some clean, beautiful themes.

1. [Sample 1](/) -- copy and customize this website! It's 4 pages=about,  teaching, research, with optional pages for your other interests or a place for student resources.
2. [Sample 2](/sample2) -- Continuous scroll -- beautiful full page image splash.  
3. [Sample 3](/sample3) -- Hyde -- a brazen left navigation column with right column content. 
4. Sample 4 -- coming soon
4. [Sample 5](/sample5) -- Mediator 
5. [Sample 6](/sample6) -- Left
6. [Sample 7](/sample7) -- Scribble

(b) you can [shop here for awesome themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/)

(c) or, for an extra fee, you can design your own! 


## Cost

Your own lovely, professional academic site is available for a low initial cost of $100, plus a monthly $5 fee for domain, hosting, site maintenance, and webmaster services. 

Alternately, for $100, I can help you design and set up your site, then teach you how to maintain it. You would then pay the monthly domain and hosting fees to those providers.
