In addition to filling out this form, interested applicants should  (1) read about St. Elizabeth's life; and (2) write a 400-800 word essay in their application answering the following question: "Which of St. Elizabeth the New Martyr's virtues  stands out to you? And how can Christian students today emulate that virtue?"

Five (5) Scholarships will be awarded per academic year (in the fall). Deadline for full consideration: July 1, 2017. Hard deadline: August 1, 2017.
