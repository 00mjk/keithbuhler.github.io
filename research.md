My research uses neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism as a framework for thinking about the relationship between facts and values, norms and nature, or ethics and science. On my view, neo-Aristotelianism is a thriving research program in ethics, political philosophy, sociology, and business because it overcomes the putative fact-value split. 

My primary research program stems from my [dissertation](/phd), titled "Becoming What We Are."  In it, I clarify and defend Philippa Foot's sort of neo-Aristotelian naturalism against that of John McDowell. [David Bradshaw](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/dbradsh){:target="_blank"} was my director. The dissertation is one part of a broader dialogue between naturalist and non-naturalist philosophers about virtue, nature, and reason. 

My dissertation is titled “Becoming What We Are: Virtue and Practical Wisdom as Natural Ends in Recent Neo-Aristotelian Ethics.” It explores the question of whether or not scientific naturalists can be realists about teleology, human nature, and traditional virtues such as practical wisdom. I conclude that what we are determines, in part, what we are to become: since we are practical rational animals capable of reasoning, we ought to become practically wise. I defend a neo-Thomist account of practical reason according to which all practical, rational animals necessarily pursue the (perceived) good and avoid (perceived) evil in every action they undertake. 

The natural result of this project is to publish a monograph on the topic of ethical naturalism. However, my project also has implications both inside and outside of ethics. I am developing a bioethical argument against transhumanist projects (such as immortality and space colonization) that uses only the assumptions of secular humanism. Furthermore, if modern science supports rather than debunks natural teleology, then we must reject a hard line division between normative disciplines such as ethics and political philosophy and descriptive disciplines such as biology and sociology. Hence, neo-Aristotelians can and should develop a philosophy of science and philosophy of education according to which the various formal and material sciences have much in common with the humanities than is commonly supposed.  

In addition to this core project, I have a long-standing interest in philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy (especially Plato's concept of dialectic), and philosophy of religion.
