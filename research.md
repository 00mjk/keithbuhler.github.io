My [research](/research) centers on neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics and metaethics, especially in the writings of Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre. Conversations about virtue ethics tend to open up into conversations about normativity and nature in general. What is the relationship between human nature and human virtue? Between facts and values? Between science and ethics? 

My goal is to overcome common objections to virtue ethics by remaining sensitive to these broader conversations. That requires clarifying what 'nature' is in notions like 'natural normativity' and 'human nature'.

The [dissertation](/phd) defends the role of a naturalized teleology in ethical naturalism according to which the concept of a 'practically wise rational animal' is both *what we already are* and *what we ought to become*. Practical wisdom (among the other virtues) defines our human life form and is the natural telos to be pursued. Hence, my thesis sits at the intersection of both normative virtue ethics and metaethics: it is normative in that it commends a life spent acquiring character and epistemic virtues even in the face of (inevitable) death and (the possibility of) human extinction; it also analyzes normative terms and concepts such as 'ought' and 'naturally good' and 'human being' to find a brute natural normativity consonant with scientific naturalism.

In this pursuit, I interact with a group of philosophers such as [Jennifer Frey](https://jennfrey.wordpress.com/), [Micah Lott](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/philosophy/faculty/lott.html), [Chris Toner](https://www.stthomas.edu/philosophy/faculty/christopher-h-toner.html), [James Barham](http://www.isnature.org/Bios/Barham.htm), and [Stephen R. Brown](http://old.briarcliff.edu/departments/theology/theo_new/brown.aspx). 

[David Bradshaw](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/dbradsh) is my dissertation director. [Anita Superson](/https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/superson), [Dan Breazeale](/https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/breazeal) and [Mark Kightlinger](/http://law.uky.edu/directory/mark-f-kightlinger) also serve as unwavering supporters and indefatigable critics.

Outside of ethics, I work on physicalism (e.g., the causal closure principle), religion, and naturalism. Future work in ethics will address issues in bioethics and  social justice.
