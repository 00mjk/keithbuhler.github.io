Iâ€™m currently writing my [dissertation](/phd) defending a naturalistic theory of virtue ethics. My main sources are Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre.

Specifically, I explore the relation between virtue, human nature, practical reason, and natural teleology. I address questions like: Is there teleology or final causation in biology? Can the irrational person be moral -- or the immoral person rational? Do virtues realize one's telos or enable one to realize it? You can read more about my [dissertation progress](/phd) here.

Besides these, other topics I am working on include [Plato, philosophy of religion, physicalism, philosophy of science, feminism and social justice issues, and the relation between philosophy and popular culture.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler).
