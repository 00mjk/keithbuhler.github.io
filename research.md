### Dissertation Research ###

My dissertation research explores virtue, practical rationality, and happiness. What exactly is a virtue and what is a vice? Is rationality a virtue? Is happiness just as "natural" as health -- and what do we mean by 'natural' anyway? 

I'm especially interested in the neo-Aristotelians: Elizabeth Anscombe, Iris Murdoch, Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Rosalind Hursthouse, Martha Nussbaum, and Michael Thompson (among others).
