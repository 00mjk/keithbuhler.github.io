My dissertation [research](/research) centers on neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism, especially the writings of Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre. I'm interested in accounts of the relation between nature and normativity: human nature and human virtue, between facts and values, and between science and ethics.  My goal is to overcome common objections to virtue ethics in general and naturalistic moral realism in particular by clarifying what 'nature' is in notions like 'natural normativity' and 'human nature'.

[David Bradshaw](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/dbradsh) is my dissertation director. [Anita Superson](/https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/superson), [Dan Breazeale](/https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/breazeal) and [Mark Kightlinger](/http://law.uky.edu/directory/mark-f-kightlinger) also serve as unwavering supporters and indefatiguable critics. 

The [dissertation](/phd) defends the role of a naturalized teleology in ethical naturalism according to which the concept of a 'practically wise rational animal' is both *what we already are* and *what we ought to become*. Practical wisdom (among the other virtues) defines our human life form and is the natural telos to be pursued.

The dissertation sits at the intersection of both normative virtue ethics and metaethics. My thesis is normative in that it commends certain kinds of actions within a certain kind of life: a life spent acquiring character and epistemic virtues even in the face of (inevitable) death and (the possibility of) human extinction. It is also metaethical in that it analyzes normative terms and concepts such as 'ought' and 'naturally good' and 'human being' to find a brute natural normativity consonant with scientific naturalism. In this pursuit, I interact with a group of philosophers such as [Jennifer Frey](https://jennfrey.wordpress.com/), [Micah Lott](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/philosophy/faculty/lott.html), [Chris Toner](https://www.stthomas.edu/philosophy/faculty/christopher-h-toner.html), [James Barham](http://www.isnature.org/Bios/Barham.htm), and [Stephen R. Brown](http://old.briarcliff.edu/departments/theology/theo_new/brown.aspx). 


Outside of these areas, I work on physicalism (i.e., the causal closure principle), religion, and naturalism. Future work in ethics will address issues in bioethics and  social justice.
