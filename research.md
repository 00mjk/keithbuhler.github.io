My research centers neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism as a framework for thinking about the relationship between ethics and science. Neo-Aristotelianism is a thriving normative *and* descriptive research program because it exposes a systematic flaw in the putative fact-value or "is-ought" gap. Hence, I defend normative claims such as that everyone has an obligation to become wise and descriptive claims such as that human nature is to be a practical, rational primate. 

My primary research program stems from my [dissertation](/phd), titled "Becoming What We Are."  In it, I clarify and defend Philippa Foot's sort of neo-Aristotelian naturalism against that of John McDowell. [David Bradshaw](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/dbradsh){:target="_blank"} was my director. 

The dissertation is one part of a dialogue between religious and secular philosophers about virtue, nature, and reason. The implications of the recent revival of neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics instigated by Catholic thinkers such as Elizabeth Anscombe and Alasdair MacIntyre has been engaged by secular thinkers such as Foot and McDowell. 

My ongoing project branches out from this research in three ways. First, though my dissertation defends what Mark Murphy calls Foot’s “secular natural law” theory ex hypothesi, I am developing a comparison of her non-religious view with other explicitly religious accounts of virtue and the Thomistic account of natural law. 

Secondly, my account of human nature contributes to recent bioethical conversations to indicate, among other things, that the pursuit of immortality through technology and the pursuit of planetary colonization are foolhardy projects, even on the assumptions of secular humanism. 

Third, my version of ethical natural rejects a hard line disciplinary division between normative ethics and descriptive sciences, so I am developing a neo-Aristotelian philosophy of science according to which both formal and material sciences share a hylomorphic structure in common. 

Outside of these topics, I work on physicalism (e.g., the causal closure principle), and Plato's concept of dialectic.
