My work is centered on virtue ethics. Though I discovered virtue ethics by way of ancients (Plato, Aristotle, Laozi) I focus on contemporary neo-Aristotelians such as Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre. I interact with recent philosophers such as [Jennifer Frey](https://jennfrey.wordpress.com/), [Micah Lott](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/philosophy/faculty/lott.html), [Chris Toner](https://www.stthomas.edu/philosophy/faculty/christopher-h-toner.html), [James Barham](http://www.isnature.org/Bios/Barham.htm), and [Stephen R Brown](http://old.briarcliff.edu/departments/theology/theo_new/brown.aspx). My goal is overcome common objections to virtue ethics in general and naturalistic moral realism in particular by clarifying what 'nature' is in notions like 'natural normativity' and 'human nature'.

[David Bradshaw](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/dbradsh) is my dissertation director. [Anita Superson](/https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/superson), [Dan Breazeale](/https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/breazeal) and [Mark Kightlinger](/http://law.uky.edu/directory/mark-f-kightlinger) also serve as unwavering supporters and indefatiguable critics. 

The [dissertation](/phd) defends the role of a naturalized teleology in ethical naturalism according to which the concept of a 'practically wise rational animal' is both *what we already are* and *what we ought to become*. Practical wisdom (among the other virtues) defines our human life form and is the natural telos to be pursued. The dissertation sits at the intersection of both normative virtue ethics and metaethics. My thesis is normative in that it commends certain kinds of actions within a certain kind of life: a life spent acquiring character and epistemic virtues even in the face of (inevitable) death and (the possibility of) human extinction. It is also metaethical in that it analyzes normative terms and concepts such as 'ought' and 'naturally good' and 'human being' to find a brute natural normativity consonant with scientific naturalism. 


Outside of these areas, I work on physicalism (i.e., causal closure principle), naturalism, and religion. Future work in ethics will address bioethics, social justice issues relating to race, class, sex, gender identity, and gender expression. My non-philosophical interests include [clay sculpture](/art), YouTubing, and [composing lists of non-philosophical interests.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)
