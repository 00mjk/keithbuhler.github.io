My research centers on naturalism and its rivals in ethics and metaphysics. I've got a revise and resubmit in the journal *Religious Studies*, which you can read more about at [Academia.edu](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler){:target="_blank"}

My [dissertation](/phd), titled "Becoming What We Are",  develops a novel form of ethical naturalism that builds on Philippa Foot and Michael Thompson's concept of natural norms. I defend Philippa Foot's ethical naturalism and criticizes that of John McDowell, whose conception of 'nature' I argue is contradictory. Virtue and especially practical wisdom are *natural*  for human beings (in a sense that I explain in detail). 

My current research Foot's "secular natural law theory" into conversation with religious theorists such as Mark Murphy, John Finnis, and Tristram Englehardt. 

More broadly, I am also interested in Plato, metaphysics, and the philosophy of religion.
