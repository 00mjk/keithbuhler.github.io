### Current Research

<img src="/img/possibleintellect.png" alt="dante-intellect" align="right" hspace="20" height="300" width="300">

I’m also currently writing my [dissertation](/fun/phd) on the virtue ethics of Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell and others. 

My research explores the relation between virtue, practical rationality, and happiness. What exactly is a virtue and what is a vice? Is rationality a virtue? Is happiness just as “natural” as health – and what do we mean by ‘natural’ anyway? Answering these questions demands an analysis of what Foot calls "natural goodness" or natural function, and a serious dialogue with metaphysical naturalism. I suspect that a defense of "natural teleology" -- properly defined -- is a key to ethical theorizing and ethical living.

I’m especially interested in dialoguing with neo-Aristotelians such as Alasdair MacIntre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, but I'm also reading a lot of Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Geach, Iris Murdoch, Rosalind Hursthouse, Martha Nussbaum, and Michael Thompson, not to mention Talbot Brewer, Stephen R. Brown, and R. Scott Smith. 

Virtue ethicists need solid responses to a variety of objections and worries: Gilbert Harman's objection from moral psychology to the very notion of character traits; the objection that the pursuit of virtue is selfish or egoistic; the objection from Bernard Williams and others that human nature is a "mess" and so the virtues cannot be perfections of our nature; the powerful (if vague) Darwinian objection from metaphysics that there is no such thing as a biological "nature" anyway; Stephen Brown's Darwinian objection that "happiness" of our species is gene propogation, which seems to transform ethics into a descriptive discipline; Ruth Millikan's objection that an organism's proper function cannot be read off its capacities but must be known via empirical history; the objection from Rehg, Lenman, and others that neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics is not "naturalistic", and more. I am a theist but very interested in metaphysical naturalism. Virtue ethics has a long history, while metaphysical naturalism has only recently attained dominance. Can a metaphysical naturalist be a virtue ethicist? John McDowell is a "relaxed naturalist" but a critic of "scientism". And Stephen R. Brown is a naturalist in the broad sense but a virtue ethicist. So I am working to see if and how a naturalist can be a virtue ethicist, and what "naturalism" might mean in this context.

#### Other interests ###

Besides these, other problems that interest me are those in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, or philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler). I've posted some papers, mostly on philosophy of mind, but one is on metaphysics and one on philosophy of religion. My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community.
