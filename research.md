My research centers on contemporary analytic virtue ethics. I converse with writers such as Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre. Read a paper or two on my [Academia.edu](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler) profile.

Several recent conversations about virtue have incited broader conversations about the relationship between science and ethics.  My [dissertation](/phd) defends the role of a naturalized teleology in ethical naturalism. I argue the metanormative thesis that some norms are "natural" in a manner that is both ethically relevant and a scientifically respectable.

In this pursuit, I interact with philosophers such as [Jennifer Frey](https://jennfrey.wordpress.com/), [Micah Lott](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/philosophy/faculty/lott.html), [Chris Toner](https://www.stthomas.edu/philosophy/faculty/christopher-h-toner.html), [James Barham](http://www.isnature.org/Bios/Barham.htm), and [Stephen R. Brown](http://old.briarcliff.edu/departments/theology/theo_new/brown.aspx). 

My dissertation director is [David Bradshaw](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/dbradsh) is my dissertation director. [Anita Superson](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/superson), [Dan Breazeale](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/breazeal) and [Mark Kightlinger](http://law.uky.edu/directory/mark-f-kightlinger) also serve as unwavering supporters and indefatigable critics. 

Outside of ethics, I work on physicalism (e.g., the causal closure principle), religion, and naturalism. Future work in ethics will address issues in bioethics and  social justice.
