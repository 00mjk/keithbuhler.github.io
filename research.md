My research uses neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism as a framework for thinking about the relationship between facts and values, norms and nature, or ethics and science. On my view, neo-Aristotelianism is a thriving research program in ethics, political philosophy, sociology, and business because it overcomes the putative fact-value split. 

My primary research program stems from my [dissertation](/phd), titled "Becoming What We Are."  In it, I clarify and defend Philippa Foot's sort of neo-Aristotelian naturalism against that of John McDowell. [David Bradshaw](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/dbradsh){:target="_blank"} was my director. The dissertation is one part of a broader dialogue between naturalist and non-naturalist philosophers about virtue, nature, and reason. 

In addition to this core project, I have a long-standing interest in philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy (especially Plato's concept of dialectic), and philosophy of religion.
