### Current Research

<img src="/img/possibleintellect.png" alt="dante-intellect" align="right" hspace="20" height="300" width="300">

Iâ€™m currently writing my [dissertation](/phd) defending a naturalistic theory of virtue ethics. My main sources are Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre.

Specifically, I explore the relation between virtue, human nature, practical reason, and natural teleology. I address questions like: Is there teleology or final causation in biology? Can the irrational person be moral -- or the immoral person rational? Do virtues realize one's telos or enable one to realize it? 

You can read more about my [dissertation progress](/phd) here.

#### Other interests ###

Besides these, other problems that interest me are those in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, or philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler).
