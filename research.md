My research centers on contemporary analytic virtue ethics. [David Bradshaw](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/users/dbradsh) is my director. 

The topic of my [dissertation](/phd) is the relation between virtue and practical reason from the perspective of ethical naturalism. In it, I defend the thesis that some of the norms that provide guidance for living virtuously are 'natural' in a manner that is both ethically relevant and a scientifically respectable. 

In this pursuit, I draw primarily on the writings of Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Rosalind Hursthouse, and Alasdair MacIntyre but also interact with recent work from other neo-Aristotelians, such as [Jennifer Frey](https://jennfrey.wordpress.com/), [Micah Lott](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/philosophy/faculty/lott.html), [Chris Toner](https://www.stthomas.edu/philosophy/faculty/christopher-h-toner.html), [James Barham](http://www.isnature.org/Bios/Barham.htm), and [Stephen R. Brown](http://old.briarcliff.edu/departments/theology/theo_new/brown.aspx). 

Outside of ethics, I work on physicalism (e.g., the causal closure principle), religion, and naturalism. Future work will address debates in bioethics, social and political philosophy, and philosophy of religion.
