### Current Research

<img src="/img/possibleintellect.png" alt="dante-intellect" align="right" hspace="20" height="300" width="300">

I’m currently writing my [dissertation](/fun/phd) on the virtue ethics of Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell and others.[^1]

[^1]:I’m especially interested in dialoguing with neo-Aristotelians but I'm also reading a lot of Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Geach, Iris Murdoch, Rosalind Hursthouse, Martha Nussbaum, and Michael Thompson, not to mention Talbot Brewer, Stephen R. Brown, and R. Scott Smith.

My research explores the relation between virtue, practical reason, and human *telos*. For example, are virtues necessary for being rational? Does being virtuous cause the realization of one's telos or constitute it? Can the irrational person be moral -- or the immoral person rational? 

As part of defending my answers, I attempt solid responses to a variety of objections and worries: 

* Gilbert Harman's objection from moral psychology to the very notion of character traits; 
* the objection that the pursuit of virtue is selfish or egoistic; 
* the objection from Bernard Williams and others that human nature is a "mess" and so the virtues cannot be perfections of our nature; 
* the powerful (if vague) Darwinian objection from metaphysics that there is no such thing as a biological "nature" anyway; 
* Stephen Brown's Darwinian objection that "happiness" of our species is gene propagation, which seems to transform ethics into a descriptive discipline; 
* Ruth Millikan's objection that an organism's proper function cannot be read off its capacities but must be known via empirical history; 
* the objection from Rehg, Lenman, and others that neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics is not "naturalistic", and more.

#### Other interests ###

Besides these, other problems that interest me are those in [philosophy of mind, ancient philosophy, or philosophy of religion.](https://uky.academia.edu/KeithBuhler). I've posted some papers, mostly on philosophy of mind, but one is on metaphysics and one on philosophy of religion. My ultimate goal of doing philosophy is to flourish as a human being in community.
