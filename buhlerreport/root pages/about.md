> He gains everyone's approval who mixes the pleasant with the useful. -- Horace

We take the occasional foray into science and technology, religion, language, workflow and personal development, and two of life's most important topics: beards, and Star Wars.  We aim to examine current events without losing touch with that which cannot be consumed by "devouring time."

The Buhler Report is a project of Keith Buhler, an academic philosopher and classical teacher in the US South. Get to know Keith's [scholarship here](http://www.keithbuhler.com/) or explore other fun projects in the [sandbox.](http://www.keithbuhler.com/fun) Philosophy students can find resources at the [philosophy portal.](http://www.keithbuhler.com/philosophy)
