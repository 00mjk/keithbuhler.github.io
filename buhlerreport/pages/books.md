## Reviews


>Written in the style of a Socratic dialogue with fewer frills (Buhler's characters do dive deep into their discussions, but get to the point much quicker) this book explores a lot of questions that modern Christians struggle with, making it a great read for anyone who loves to think and discuss relevant religious topics. Buhler writes with Socratic humility and his characters discuss with intelligence and occasional dry wit. 

>Like the dialectic in real life, the discussion Buhler begins in 'Sola' does not end with the final page. He uses the written word as a way to encourage and direct readers who find themselves in aporia. The tension between Truth and our understanding of Truth rarely slackens, but 'Sola' at least points us to some of the pertinent questions surrounding the subject. And by pointing to those bigger questions, Buhler invites the reader into the drama of the dialectic--of inquiring, analyzing, arguing, and hopefully falling more in love with Truth.


>This is a marvelous book. I highly recommend it to people interested in doctrine and want to read a different presentation of it. It is definitely one that I will re-read in the future and try to understand more clearly

>This book is unlike any book I've ever read before (except for maybe Plato's writings).
