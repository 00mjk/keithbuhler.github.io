If you want to innovate, you have to play. 

If you want to create, you have to engage in low-risk experiments. 

If you want to succeed, you have to develop a high failure tolerance. 

I call this kind of play, experimentation, and controlled failure "sandboxing."

In software development, a [sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)) is:

>A testing environment that isolates untested code changes... from the production environment. 



Play is preparation; play is necessary for brain growth. Kids who play xbox or what not have higher 10-20% brain growth. “Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi said play is a flow state where we have just the right balance of challenge and opportunity given our skill sets; in the state of play we are so completely absorbed by our activity to the point which nothing else in the world seems to matter.”(https://www.good.is/articles/how-to-be-more-productive-and-creative-at-work-play-more) “Classrooms instill a fear of mistakes, and don’t put enough emphasis on imagination, intuition, or spontaneity. But without enough play, we lose creativity. Studies show that humans can have a play deficit just like the well-documented sleep deficit. Adults who play are actually shown to be more productive at work and in business than adults who do not play. “ “The first condition is having the confidence to fail, so that you can take risks within your work.”

- Structure of a Sandbox: 
    - Sand, the raw material to play with.
    - Box to contain the sand within bounds.
    - Tactile hands to feel the sand tactily and to manipulate it. 
    - Forms, shovels, to mold and shape the sand.
    - Water, to modify the raw material according to spectrum of soft, to hard, to soft again. 
    - Ideas: I could make a castle! or a hill! or a hole in the ground! Or write letters! or…!

- Examples: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Room_coffee_pot
    - Sand: camera, computers, and a network.
    - Box: a single camera
    - Hands: the programmers playing with the X Window system protocols
    - Forms: existing imaging software, existing transmission software
    - Ideas: I could take a picture of the current state of the coffee pot and transmit it to all the members of the Computer Lab at Cambridge. 

Example: the Wright Brothers’ airplane
- Sand: bike parts, printing presses, motors, and machines, spruce wood, 
- Box: a size, shape, and wind-tunnel
- Forms: wings, engines, and control sticks; bird wings, bikes, cars, trains
- Ideas: we could make flying machine that is controllable by the pilot!
- The brothers played with a small toy helicopter when they were 6 and 11, respectively, which they played with until it broke. Then they built a new one themselves. They conceived and built and reconciled and rebuilt hundreds of machines. They built the Flyer I, the Flyer II, the Flyer III. Iteration after iteration. 


Wonderland: how triviality is the mother of invention. People make the most breakthroughs where they are having the most fun. People enjoy themselves, do things for their own sake — those people are more innovative than some
