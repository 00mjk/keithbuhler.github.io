## My Story with Classical Education

There are many tasks we are given not because we are worthy -- but because they need to be done. Parenting is like this. No one is really up for the awesome task of raising a child, but it needs to be done. Education is also like this. We don't have to be experts at education to dive in. Classical education is simply a commitment to do what has worked in our own time. In that sense, "Classical education" is a diverse set of best practices. 

Classical education, in my experience, has three distinctives: Great Books, Great Conversation, Great Hearts. What we learn is different; how we learn is different; and *why* we learn is different. 

In my experience classical education has three main distinctives. I was homeschooled myself through most of my pre-college education. 

I went to high school but I left early. (Students don’t tell your parents that your teacher dropped out of high school!)

The high school counselor, God bless him, asked me what I wanted in a college and all I knew was that I did not want "High School II: This Time It's College."

I always loved reading because my mom taught me to read. She put lots of books in the house and I was always reading. 

He recommended a Great Books school. I was accepted to Thomas Aquinas but ended up getting a last minute spot at the Torrey Honors Institute. 

### Torrey Honors Program. 

At college,  we didn't just read some good books. I experienced a whole person transformation. 

It was an emotional shift the spiritual shift and intellectual shift a social shift in my life and new friends with whom I could talk about new ideas in a sense I was estranged from my family until I could find the words to explain what was going on inside of me. They had no idea and I was falling in love -- not just with books -- but with ideas, with investigation, with science, with truth. 

But with truths and realities perhaps most importantly, I was coming to learn what Christians believe and why and how I fell short. We often say a good thing to do is to learn what you believe and why. And that's true so far as it goes, but I didn't really believe it, but I didn't even know. I didn't really believe it and I didn't know why it's not that I had tried Christianity and it was found wanting. It said it was found difficult and I didn't even try. 

Now I was exposed to the best secular thinking the best pagan thinking, yes even the best anti-Christian thinking Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Marx Immanuel Kant and I was able to see for the first time that the Christian view of truth. In fact, Christ himself. (Christ's worldview, if you will) can win in the market of ideas.

We're not making this stuff up. Smart Christians discovered these truths. They presented us, in synergy with God's own revelation of himself and his world, the best interpretation of God, man, the past, the present, and the future.  stepped in and said let dice you not getting it but me explain how the creation happened and we take this and we try to understand it. And we deepen it. We take the revelation we received and this is the truth and within the Christian community across all time up to the present moment and continuing on in the next generation. There's a fence outside which we know that there's error and sin and falsehood, and within which there some room to play. There's ideas we can banter about on the philosopher so like analyzing concepts all the concepts that I analyze are all that important so that some of its cow like doing a puzzle in some of its dangerous some of its I might have to take a class in a graduate program and analyze really, really wicked ideas like suppose there is no morality I guess that could be true but it's dangerous to think about the dangers to consider it and yet professionally and personally I'm interested in looking at that and coming to the answer, yes there is morality and this can be argued both from science (see Richard Dawkins) from philosophy (see Thomas Aquinas) and Descartes and even Plato himself and from theology in so it classical education context. 

My education became real life. It wasn't books go to school and learn some lessons and then go out into the big world and and see what life's really all about. It was let's bring real life into school and begin to practice on some of these big ideas. These dangerous ideas, these life-saving ideas. These truths from wherever they come and save my faith and so I think that Christianity is true. Yes because my parents taught me. And also because I looked into it and also because it makes you a good person and also because people that I trust in the past testify to it and also because those who are not Christians are either not Christians for bad reasons, though Christians are hypocritical when you're not look where all hypocritical the question is what's the right standard to hold to or because they're it never looked into it they never looked into both sides. 

### Lewis's Story

C.S. Lewis was shipped off to boarding school as a nice young British boy when he was about 10 years old. After some bad luck with schools, he ended up studying with a private tutor whom his dad always said was a really nice fellow and a good friend. William Kirkpatrick turned out to be an iron-fisted ruler of education. Kirkpatrick made Lewis learn Greek and Latin by reading Homer and Ovid and Virgil with a dictionary and grammar book. Even though Lewis had already lost his faith, these books opened  the world to him: the best art, the best architecture, the best science, the best music, and so on. One can only be a non-Christian for so long if one who is passionate about the truth and who had the honor to follow the argument wherever it led into stick to his own promises. 

He eventually found they found the Anglican Christian expression that was so out of fashion in his time. "Jack" as he was known to his friends, Lewis started swimming against the stream and he got nothing for it. He lost friends, he lost jobs. 

He was insulted. He was ill reputed in his little college and he wrote a few books that have been made into movies called the *Chronicles of Narnia* and the first three or four films so far have grossed $1 billion all over the world. This man's intellect which was so passionately Christian, so powerfully intelligent, that these books persuaded thousands to the faith driving them back to the Bible, back to the son of God the gamut that ironfisted educator in England foreseeable learn history paradigms against his will so hold out hope. There's a lot to this. We're not perfect, but we see what we could have ever going for it. 

### Conclusion

So as we all pursue her continuing education if the kingdom. May help us to become better students, better disciples,  better Christians in the service of his gospel, for of all his people Christian or non-Christian, until we come to see the good, the true the beautiful itself, Jesus Christ our Lord.




## Speech Transcript -- Three Components of Classical Education

![fun books](http://keithbuhler.com/images/fun-books3.png)

### 1. Great Books 

There at least three components to classical education. The first is the "great books." *What* we study is unique. You'll never study a textbook that was written by committee of policy makers on Capitol Hill with a year of classroom experience between them and only God knows what agenda. 

You may find textbooks, but they'll be written by classical educators like [Dorothy Sayers], [Martin Cothran] or [Christopher Perrin]. Mostly, you'll find real books: The Holy Bible; the Republic of Plato; the city of God by Augustine. 

We read not only modern classics like C.S. Lewis's *Narnia* and J.R.R. Tolkien's *the Hobbit*, but we read old books. The *Tao te Ching* which influenced C.S. Lewis; Beowulf, which influenced Tolkien.

What makes a "great book" great? This is a hard question. But here are a few reflections. 

Suppose there's a scale of quality from 1-100. Sturgeon's Law says that 90% of anything made is junk. So most books written are not worth reading. 

But good books are "good enough." If someone recommends a book to you that's a 75 on that scale, it's probably worth reading. I will go see a movie if it gets more than a 75% on Rotten Tomatoes. It's worth seeing. 

Then there are "really good" books that have an impact on your life, that you recommend to others, and re-read multiple times. Suppose these are in the 90s or 95s. 

The great books are like anywhere between 99.95 and 99.99 in terms of the quality. 

The impact, the power, of these books can hardly be calculated. These are books that -- before the printing press -- people took the time to recopy and so we just read them. So why not start there? 

There's nothing magical about old books; if you get the best books from the future we would read those!  But the fact is, the best old books are ones we have had time to be whittled out. 

It's like watching the 10 best TV shows of the last what, 60 years. How long has TV been around. Some TV shows are immoral. Others are not immoral but are just not very good. They are forgettable. 

Others are "good enough" to watch, like Home Improvement. I never want to watch it again, but it was fun at the time. Some others make a lasting impact. I've seen every Little House on the Prairie episode twice. Arrested Development is genuinely impressive comedy. X-Men the Animated Series is still better or as good as the recent movies. These are worth re-watching. There are a few others. 

But TV and film are incredibly young artistic media. The fact is, most TV and film are junk. In 100 years, we'll have better perspective on what rises to the top. 

Finally, we read great books because God wrote a Holy Book. Western civilization is built upon books far more than it is built on oral tradition. 

We don't just read books -- we do "Great Texts". Music, film, painting, architecture Wherever goodness, truth, and beauty can be found, that’s we’re going to discuss. If God made a Holy Movie maybe we’d study more films. 


### Great Conversation 

![dialogue](/fun-discussion.png)

The second distinctive is discussion oriented education called Socratic discussion called it interactive classroom college dialogue. 

There's something consistently look at classical schools and even some charter schools are doing this now and small colleges naturally build their classrooms around discussion. This requires smaller class sizes, which is one of the limitations it only gets me students into a room with an educator, expect there to have it. Expect them to have a discussion, so why discussion? 

1. Recollection. Research suggests that whatever you teach me, I'll remember only partially. Socratic dialogue: Studies show that students retain 5 times more (50% instead of 10%) that they learn in an interactive environment. 
2. Relationship.  We come to know each other and ourselves in dialogue. Dialogue, like life, is genuinely relational. Over time, students and mentors come to be friends, co-learners, sometimes for a lifetime. 
3. Co-learning. Believe it or not, teachers are still learning themselves. Teaching through dialogue allows teachers to be far more flexible in their subject matter, venturing into unknown territory with confidence. When I discuss new books with students, or new passages of books I've read, I ask genuine questions I don't know the answer to. 
4. Critical thinking. There is a group called [Philosophy for Kids](http://depts.washington.edu/nwcenter/) that begins asking questions in 2nd grade. These children are discussing the ethics of self-sacrifice in *The Giving Tree*, and doing so with gusto and clear understanding. You can see these eight-year-olds seven-year-olds is a six-year-old teaching the teacher about ethics because they get and really driving home points but I'm certain her last them for years to come if not the rest of your life and making arguments engaging in logical discourse. They may not have my philosophy grad student vocabulary but they have some of my philosophy grad student ideas and so when we take the great books put them in front of you and you read them and I read them and your parents read them. We cannot talk about. We're all dying to talk about. 
5. Lifelong learning. I've spent more than 1500 hours leading discussions in class and in a book club and I'm still a beginner. It's a discipline like chess where you can be competent but there is always something to learn.  I can make mistakes and listen to my students when they complain or correct. I don't say, "I'm the expert here, who are you to have an opinion?" I say, "Duly noted, you're probably right, let's work on getting better." It's a group project because it's careful it's disciplined or not your sharing our opinions. It's going somewhere and yet it's real life role coming to this book, trying to understand.



### Great Hearts

The third distinction is the motivation for education itself. 

Why do we do education if you have someone why they're going to school you realize the motivation has been lost. Why are you going to school so I can go to more school is basically answer why are you going to this high school so I can get into a good college but then why get into a good college psyching get a good job will I get a good job so I can have lots of money. Why have lots of money so I can afford to send my kids to a good school. This doesn't make sense and also if you're getting an education just to get a good job. There's 100 more efficient ways to do so right how many of you were working by the time you're 16 and it just turns out that's a better way to prepare for your job. Where were headed is character formation and it's not just character formation, its character transformation because Jesus Christ was a human being and he was God. Jesus Christ is fully divine and fully human, and we are called the walk in his footsteps. So to remain merely human is not her calling, but Paul as Paul says to grope the full stature to be sons of God to be united to Christ in our education. Yes at the kindergarten in the prekindergarten level at the high school level at the college level at the graduate school level at the level of working in your career and continuing education is about answering that calling. It's about not just learning some new fax but overcoming my sins overcoming my ignorance I God's grace and that starts with knowledge of ignorance that starts with repentance and so school and church and family work in harmony to produce the same goal parents what you want, except for a student, a child who grows up to be mature, loving, caring, compassionate, responsible in a word, a virtuous human being and what church are we therefore yes to pay God is due to worship God to follow God to obey God what is God tell us to do P holy as my father in heaven is holy or in Paul's words be like Christ as I am like Christ. And so in school were not detracting from that purpose. God forbid, were not training people to disbelieve the tenets of the faith were not training people to do whatever they want or not passing out tools that no high school student who's not married should touch in the name of education were advancing the calling that we've been given by God. The responsibility individually and corporately that we've been given to pursue his son and to become like his son and don't ask me how it happened but it it happens when we sit around a book of Plato and have a hard discussion, it happens. We sit around the gospel of John, and have a hard discussion is only one part of the People's part of the puzzle but it's an important part in it something that you can be a part of is your chill child reads virtual in Lawrenceville Roman history and as they learn how to learn which will take them on into adulthood and treat them well. 





## FAQ

**1. Should I consider classical education for my family?** 
The short answer is, ‘Yes!’ Every American family should know their options, including home school, private school, charter school, and more. 

Classical schools can combine the flexibility of home-school cooperative network with the rigor of a 2-day college preparatory model —  guided throughout by a commitment to classical education. 

**2. Is classical education for me?** 
Classical education is a wonderful option for many families. But even if you are already pursuing homeschooling in a Christian environment, you have options.  So you may be asking the practical question, “Is it for me?” and “Is it for my child?” 

This discernment process takes time and prayer. Every family ought to know first of all that the classical education movement exists. If you’re here, you know!The next step then is to ask... What is it? And why do it?
